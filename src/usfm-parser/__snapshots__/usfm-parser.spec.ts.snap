"# Genesis
### 1
<em>1</em>In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth. 
<em>2</em>Now the earth was formless and void, and darkness was over the surface of the deep. And the Spirit of God was hovering over the surface of the waters. 
<em>3</em>And God said, “Let there be light,” and there was light. 
### 2
<em>1</em>Thus the heavens and the earth were completed in all their vast array.
