\s1 The Beginning
\r (Genesis 1:1–2; Hebrews 11:1–3)
\b
\m 
\v 1 In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. 
\v 2 He was with God in the beginning. 
\v 3 Through Him all things were made, and without Him nothing was made that has been made. 
\v 4 In Him was life, and that life was the light of men. 
\v 5 The Light shines in the darkness, and the darkness has not overcome \f + \fr 1:5 \ft Or comprehended\f* it. 
\s1 The Witness of John
\b
\m 
\v 6 There came a man who was sent from God. His name was John. 
\v 7 He came as a witness to testify about the Light, so that through him everyone might believe. 
\v 8 He himself was not the Light, but he came to testify about the Light. 
\b
\m 
\v 9 The true Light who gives light to every man was coming into the world. 
\v 10 He was in the world, and though the world was made through Him, the world did not recognize Him. 
\v 11 He came to His own, and His own did not receive Him. 
\v 12 But to all who did receive Him, to those who believed in His name, He gave the right to become children of God—
\v 13 children born not of blood, nor of the desire or will of man, but born of God. 
\s1 The Word Became Flesh
\r (Psalm 84:1–12)
\b
\m 
\v 14 The Word became flesh and made His dwelling among us.\f + \fr 1:14 \ft Or and tabernacled among us\f* We have seen His glory, the glory of the one and only Son \f + \fr 1:14 \ft Or the Only Begotten or the Unique One\f* from the Father, full of grace and truth. 
\b
\m 
\v 15 John testified concerning Him. He cried out, saying, “This is He of whom I said, ‘He who comes after me has surpassed me because He was before me.’” 
\b
\m 
\v 16 From His fullness we have all received grace upon grace. 
\v 17 For the law was given through Moses; grace and truth came through Jesus Christ. 
\v 18 No one has ever seen God, but the one and only Son, who is Himself God and \f + \fr 1:18 \ft Or but the only begotten God, who; BYZ and TR but the only begotten Son, who\f* is at the Father’s side,\f + \fr 1:18 \ft Greek in the Father’s bosom\f* has made Him known. 
\s1 The Mission of John the Baptist
\r (Isaiah 40:1–5; Matthew 3:1–12; Mark 1:1–8; Luke 3:1–20)
\b
\m 
\v 19 And this was John’s testimony when the Jews of Jerusalem sent priests and Levites to ask him, “Who are you?” 
\v 20 He did not refuse to confess, but openly declared, “I am not the Christ.” 
\b
\m 
\v 21 “Then who are you?” they inquired. “Are you Elijah?” 
\b
\m He said, “I am not.” 
\b
\m “Are you the Prophet?” 
\b
\m He answered, “No.” 
\b
\m 
\v 22 So they said to him, “Who are you? We need an answer for those who sent us. What do you say about yourself?” 
\b
\m 
\v 23 John replied in the words of Isaiah the prophet: 
\b
\q1 “I am a voice of one calling in the wilderness, 
\q2 ‘Make straight the way for the Lord.’”\f + \fr 1:23 \ft Isaiah 40:3 (see also LXX)\f* 
\b
\m 
\v 24 Then the Pharisees who had been sent 
\v 25 asked him, “Why then do you baptize, if you are not the Christ, nor Elijah, nor the Prophet?” 
\b
\m 
\v 26 “I baptize with \f + \fr 1:26 \ft Or in; also in verse 31 and twice in 33\f* water,” John replied, “but among you stands One you do not know. 
\v 27 He is the One who comes after me, the straps of whose sandals I am not worthy to untie.” 
\b
\m 
\v 28 All this happened at Bethany beyond the Jordan, where John was baptizing. 
\s1 Jesus the Lamb of God
\r (Matthew 3:13–17; Mark 1:9–11; Luke 3:21–22)
\b
\m 
\v 29 The next day John saw Jesus coming toward him and said, “Look, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world! 
\v 30 This is He of whom I said, ‘A man who comes after me has surpassed me because He was before me.’ 
\v 31 I myself did not know Him, but the reason I came baptizing with water was that He might be revealed to Israel.” 
\b
\m 
\v 32 Then John testified, “I saw the Spirit descending from heaven like a dove and resting on Him. 
\v 33 I myself did not know Him, but the One who sent me to baptize with water told me, ‘The man on whom you see the Spirit descend and rest is He who will baptize with the Holy Spirit.’ 
\v 34 I have seen and testified that this is the Son of God.\f + \fr 1:34 \ft SBL the Chosen One of God\f*” 
\s1 The First Disciples
\r (Matthew 4:18–22; Mark 1:16–20; Luke 5:1–11)
\b
\m 
\v 35 The next day John was there again with two of his disciples. 
\v 36 When he saw Jesus walking by, he said, “Look, the Lamb of God!” 
\v 37 And when the two disciples heard him say this, they followed Jesus. 
\b
\m 
\v 38 Jesus turned and saw them following. \wj “What do you want?”\wj* He asked. 
\b
\m They said to Him, “Rabbi” (which means Teacher), “where are You staying?” 
\b
\m 
\v 39 \wj “Come and see,”\wj* He replied. So they went and saw where He was staying, and spent that day with Him. It was about the tenth hour.\f + \fr 1:39 \ft That is, about four in the afternoon\f* 
\b
\m 
\v 40 Andrew, Simon Peter’s brother, was one of the two who heard John’s testimony and followed Jesus. 
\v 41 He first found his brother Simon and told him, “We have found the Messiah” (which is translated as Christ). 
\b
\m 
\v 42 Andrew brought him to Jesus, who looked at him and said, \wj “You are Simon son of John. You will be called Cephas”\wj* (which is translated as Peter). 
\s1 Jesus Calls Philip and Nathanael
\b
\m 
\v 43 The next day Jesus decided to set out for Galilee. Finding Philip, He told him, \wj “Follow Me.”\wj* 
\v 44 Now Philip was from Bethsaida, the same town as Andrew and Peter. 
\b
\m 
\v 45 Philip found Nathanael and told him, “We have found the One Moses wrote about in the Law, the One the prophets foretold—Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph.” 
\b
\m 
\v 46 “Can anything good come from Nazareth?” Nathanael asked. 
\b
\m “Come and see,” said Philip. 
\b
\m 
\v 47 When Jesus saw Nathanael approaching, He said of him, \wj “Here is a true Israelite, in whom there is no deceit.”\wj* 
\b
\m 
\v 48 “How do You know me?” Nathanael asked. 
\b
\m Jesus replied, \wj “Before Philip called you, I saw you under the fig tree.”\wj* 
\b
\m 
\v 49 “Rabbi,” Nathanael answered, “You are the Son of God! You are the King of Israel!” 
\b
\m 
\v 50 Jesus said to him, \wj “Do you believe just because I told you I saw you under the fig tree? You will see greater things than these.”\wj* 
\v 51 Then He declared, \wj “Truly, truly, I tell you, you will all see heaven open and the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of Man.”\wj*\f + \fr 1:51 \ft See Genesis 28:12.\f* 
\c 2
\s1 The Wedding at Cana
\b
\m 
\v 1 On the third day a wedding took place at Cana in Galilee. Jesus’ mother was there, 
\v 2 and Jesus and His disciples had also been invited to the wedding. 
\v 3 When the wine ran out, Jesus’ mother said to Him, “They have no more wine.” 
\b
\m 
\v 4 \wj “Woman, why does this concern us?”\wj* Jesus replied. \wj “My hour has not yet come.”\wj* 
\b
\m 
\v 5 His mother said to the servants, “Do whatever He tells you.” 
\b
\m 
\v 6 Now six stone water jars had been set there for the Jewish rites of purification. Each could hold from twenty to thirty gallons.\f + \fr 2:6 \ft Greek two or three metretae; that is, approximately 20.8 to 31.2 gallons (78.8 to 118.1 liters)\f* 
\v 7 Jesus told the servants, \wj “Fill the jars with water.”\wj* 
\b
\m So they filled them to the brim. 
\b
\m 
\v 8 \wj “Now draw some out,”\wj* He said, \wj “and take it to the master of the banquet.”\wj* 
\b
\m They did so, 
\v 9 and the master of the banquet tasted the water that had been turned into wine. He did not know where it was from, but the servants who had drawn the water knew. Then he called the bridegroom aside 
\v 10 and said, “Everyone serves the fine wine first, and then the cheap wine after the guests are drunk. But you have saved the fine wine until now!” 
\b
\m 
\v 11 Jesus performed this, the first of His signs, at Cana in Galilee. He thus revealed His glory, and His disciples believed in Him. 
\s1 Jesus Cleanses the Temple
\r (Matthew 21:12–17; Mark 11:15–19; Luke 19:45–48)
\b
\m 
\v 12 After this, He went down to Capernaum with His mother and brothers and His disciples, and they stayed there a few days. 
\b
\m 
\v 13 When the Jewish Passover was near, Jesus went up to Jerusalem. 
\v 14 In the temple courts \f + \fr 2:14 \ft Literally the temple; also in verse 15\f* He found men selling cattle, sheep, and doves, and money changers seated at their tables. 
\v 15 So He made a whip out of cords and drove all from the temple courts, both sheep and cattle. He poured out the coins of the money changers and overturned their tables. 
\v 16 To those selling doves He said, \wj “Get these out of here! How dare you turn My Father’s house into a marketplace!”\wj* 
\b
\m 
\v 17 His disciples remembered that it is written: “Zeal for Your house will consume Me.”\f + \fr 2:17 \ft Psalm 69:9\f* 
\b
\m 
\v 18 On account of this, the Jews demanded, “What sign can You show us to prove Your authority to do these things?” 
\b
\m 
\v 19 Jesus answered, \wj “Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up again.”\wj* 
\b
\m 
\v 20 “This temple took forty-six years to build,” the Jews replied, “and You are going to raise it up in three days?” 
\b
\m 
\v 21 But Jesus was speaking about the temple of His body. 
\v 22 After He was raised from the dead, His disciples remembered that He had said this. Then they believed the Scripture and the word that Jesus had spoken. 
\b
\m 
\v 23 While He was in Jerusalem at the Passover Feast, many people saw the signs He was doing and believed in His name. 
\v 24 But Jesus did not entrust Himself to them, for He knew them all. 
\v 25 He did not need any testimony about man, for He knew what was in a man. 
\c 3
\s1 Jesus and Nicodemus
\r (Genesis 22:1–10; Romans 5:6–11)
\b
\m 
\v 1 Now there was a man of the Pharisees named Nicodemus, a leader of the Jews. 
\v 2 He came to Jesus at night and said, “Rabbi, we know that You are a teacher who has come from God. For no one could perform the signs You are doing if God were not with him.” 
\b
\m 
\v 3 Jesus replied, \wj “Truly, truly, I tell you, no one can see the kingdom of God unless he is born again.\wj*\f + \fr 3:3 \ft Or born from above; also in verse 7.\f*\wj ”\wj* 
\b
\m 
\v 4 “How can a man be born when he is old?” Nicodemus asked. “Can he enter his mother’s womb a second time to be born?” 
\b
\m 
\v 5 Jesus answered, \wj “Truly, truly, I tell you, no one can enter the kingdom of God unless he is born of water and the Spirit.\wj* 
\v 6 \wj Flesh is born of flesh, but spirit is born of the Spirit.\wj* 
\v 7 \wj Do not be amazed that I said, ‘You\wj* \f + \fr 3:7 \ft The Greek word for you is plural; also in verse 12.\f*\wj must be born again.’\wj* 
\v 8 \wj The wind blows where it wishes. You hear its sound, but you do not know where it comes from or where it is going. So it is with everyone born of the Spirit.”\wj* 
\b
\m 
\v 9 “How can this be?” Nicodemus asked. 
\b
\m 
\v 10 \wj “You are Israel’s teacher,”\wj* said Jesus, \wj “and you do not understand these things?\wj* 
\v 11 \wj Truly, truly, I tell you, we speak of what we know, and we testify to what we have seen, and yet you people do not accept our testimony.\wj* 
\b
\m 
\v 12 \wj If I have told you about earthly things and you do not believe, how will you believe if I tell you about heavenly things?\wj* 
\v 13 \wj No one has ascended into heaven except the One who descended from heaven—the Son of Man.\wj*\f + \fr 3:13 \ft BYZ and TR include who is in heaven.\f* 
\v 14 \wj Just as Moses lifted up the snake in the wilderness, so the Son of Man must be lifted up,\wj* 
\v 15 \wj that everyone who believes in Him may have eternal life.\wj*\f + \fr 3:15 \ft Or everyone who believes may have eternal life in Him.\f* 
\b
\m 
\v 16 \wj For God so loved the world that He gave His one and only\wj* \f + \fr 3:16 \ft Or only begotten or unique; also in verse 18\f*\wj Son, that everyone who believes in Him shall not perish but have eternal life.\wj* 
\v 17 \wj For God did not send His Son into the world to condemn the world, but to save the world through Him.\wj* 
\v 18 \wj Whoever believes in Him is not condemned, but whoever does not believe has already been condemned, because he has not believed in the name of God’s one and only Son.\wj* 
\b
\m 
\v 19 \wj And this is the verdict: The Light has come into the world, but men loved the darkness rather than the Light because their deeds were evil.\wj* 
\v 20 \wj Everyone who does evil hates the Light, and does not come into the Light for fear that his deeds will be exposed.\wj* 
\v 21 \wj But whoever practices the truth comes into the Light, so that it may be seen clearly that what he has done has been accomplished in God.”\wj*\f + \fr 3:21 \ft Some translators close this quotation after verse 15.\f* 
\s1 John’s Testimony about Jesus
\b
\m 
\v 22 After this, Jesus and His disciples went into the Judean countryside, where He spent some time with them and baptized. 
\b
\m 
\v 23 Now John was also baptizing at Aenon near Salim, because the water was plentiful there, and people kept coming to be baptized. 
\v 24 (For John had not yet been thrown into prison.) 
\b
\m 
\v 25 Then a dispute arose between John’s disciples and a certain Jew \f + \fr 3:25 \ft TR and the Jews\f* over the issue of ceremonial washing. 
\v 26 So John’s disciples came to him and said, “Look, Rabbi, the One who was with you beyond the Jordan, the One you testified about—He is baptizing, and everyone is going to Him.” 
\b
\m 
\v 27 John replied, “A man can receive only what is given him from heaven. 
\v 28 You yourselves can testify that I said, ‘I am not the Christ, but am sent ahead of Him.’ 
\v 29 The bride belongs to the bridegroom. The friend of the bridegroom stands and listens for him, and is overjoyed to hear the bridegroom’s voice. That joy is mine, and it is now complete. 
\v 30 He must increase; I must decrease. 
\b
\m 
\v 31 The One who comes from above is above all. The one who is from the earth belongs to the earth and speaks as one from the earth. The One who comes from heaven is above all.\f + \fr 3:31 \ft Tischendorf The One comes from heaven.\f* 
\v 32 He testifies to what He has seen and heard, yet no one accepts His testimony. 
\v 33 Whoever accepts His testimony has certified that God is truthful. 
\v 34 For the One whom God has sent speaks the words of God, for God gives the Spirit without limit. 
\b
\m 
\v 35 The Father loves the Son and has placed all things in His hands. 
\v 36 Whoever believes in the Son has eternal life. Whoever rejects the Son will not see life. Instead, the wrath of God remains on him.”\f + \fr 3:36 \ft Some translators close this quotation after verse 30.\f* 
\c 4
\s1 Jesus and the Samaritan Woman
\b
\m
\v 1 When Jesus realized that the Pharisees were aware He \f + \fr 4:1 \ft Literally When therefore Jesus knew that the Pharisees had heard that Jesus; NE, WH, BYZ, and TR When therefore the Lord knew that the Pharisees had heard that Jesus\f* was gaining and baptizing more disciples than John
\v 2 (although it was not Jesus who baptized, but His disciples),
\v 3 He left Judea and returned to Galilee.
\b
\m
\v 4 Now He had to pass through Samaria.
\v 5 So He came to a town of Samaria called Sychar, near the plot of ground that Jacob had given to his son Joseph.
\v 6 Since Jacob’s well was there, Jesus, weary from His journey, sat down by the well. It was about the sixth hour.\f + \fr 4:6 \ft That is, about noon\f*
\b
\m
\v 7 When a Samaritan woman came to draw water, Jesus said to her, \wj “Give Me a drink.”\wj*
\v 8 (His disciples had gone into the town to buy food.)
\b
\m
\v 9 “You are a Jew,” said the woman. “How can You ask for a drink from me, a Samaritan woman?” (For Jews do not associate with Samaritans.)\f + \fr 4:9 \ft Tischendorf does not include this sentence.\f*
\b
\m
\v 10 Jesus answered, \wj “If you knew the gift of God and who is asking you for a drink, you would have asked Him, and He would have given you living water.”\wj*
\b
\m
\v 11 “Sir,” the woman replied, “You have nothing to draw with and the well is deep. Where then will You get this living water?
\v 12 Are You greater than our father Jacob, who gave us this well and drank from it himself, as did his sons and his livestock?”
\b
\m
\v 13 Jesus said to her, \wj “Everyone who drinks this water will be thirsty again.\wj*
\v 14 \wj But whoever drinks the water I give him will never thirst. Indeed, the water I give him will become in him a fount of water springing up to eternal life.”\wj*
\b
\m
\v 15 The woman said to Him, “Sir, give me this water so that I will not get thirsty and have to keep coming here to draw water.”
\b
\m
\v 16 Jesus told her, \wj “Go, call your husband and come back.”\wj*
\b
\m
\v 17 “I have no husband,” the woman replied.
\b
\m Jesus said to her, \wj “You are correct to say that you have no husband.\wj*
\v 18 \wj In fact, you have had five husbands, and the man you now have is not your husband. You have spoken truthfully.”\wj*
\b
\m
\v 19 “Sir,” the woman said, “I see that You are a prophet.
\v 20 Our fathers worshiped on this mountain, but you Jews say that the place where one must worship is in Jerusalem.”
\b
\m
\v 21 \wj “Believe Me, woman,”\wj* Jesus replied, \wj “a time is coming when you will worship the Father neither on this mountain nor in Jerusalem.\wj*
\v 22 \wj You worship what you do not know; we worship what we do know, for salvation is from the Jews.\wj*
\v 23 \wj But a time is coming and has now come when the true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and in truth, for the Father is seeking such as these to worship Him.\wj*
\v 24 \wj God is Spirit, and His worshipers must worship Him in spirit and in truth.”\wj*
\b
\m
\v 25 The woman said, “I know that Messiah” (called Christ) “is coming. When He comes, He will explain everything to us.”
\b
\m
\v 26 Jesus answered, \wj “I who speak to you am He.”\wj*
\s1 The Disciples Return and Marvel
\b
\m
\v 27 Just then His disciples returned and were surprised that He was speaking with a woman. But no one asked Him, “What do You want from her?” or “Why are You talking with her?”
\b
\m
\v 28 Then the woman left her water jar, went back into the town, and said to the people,
\v 29 “Come, see a man who told me everything I ever did. Could this be the Christ?”
\v 30 So they left the town and made their way toward Jesus.
\b
\m
\v 31 Meanwhile the disciples urged Him, “Rabbi, eat something.”
\b
\m
\v 32 But He told them, \wj “I have food to eat that you know nothing about.”\wj*
\b
\m
\v 33 So the disciples asked one another, “Could someone have brought Him food?”
\b
\m
\v 34 Jesus explained, \wj “My food is to do the will of Him who sent Me and to finish His work.\wj*
\v 35 \wj Do you not say, ‘There are still four months until the harvest’? I tell you, lift up your eyes and look at the fields, for they are ripe\wj* \f + \fr 4:35 \ft Literally white\f*\wj for harvest.\wj*
\b
\m
\v 36 \wj Already the reaper draws his wages and gathers a crop for eternal life, so that the sower and the reaper may rejoice together.\wj*
\v 37 \wj For in this case the saying ‘One sows and another reaps’ is true.\wj*
\v 38 \wj I sent you to reap what you have not worked for; others have done the hard work, and now you have taken up their labor.”\wj*
\s1 Many Samaritans Believe
\b
\m
\v 39 Many of the Samaritans from that town believed in Jesus because of the woman’s testimony, “He told me everything I ever did.”
\v 40 So when the Samaritans came to Him, they asked Him to stay with them, and He stayed two days.
\b
\m
\v 41 And many more believed because of His message.
\v 42 They said to the woman, “We now believe not only because of your words; we have heard for ourselves, and we know that this man truly is the Savior of the world.”
\s1 Jesus Heals the Official’s Son
\r (Matthew 8:5–13; Luke 7:1–10)
\b
\m
\v 43 After two days, Jesus left for Galilee.
\v 44 Now He Himself had testified that a prophet has no honor in his own hometown.
\v 45 Yet when He arrived, the Galileans welcomed Him. They had seen all the great things He had done in Jerusalem at the feast, for they had gone there as well.
\b
\m
\v 46 So once again He came to Cana in Galilee, where He had turned the water into wine. And there was a royal official whose son lay sick at Capernaum.
\v 47 When he heard that Jesus had come from Judea to Galilee, he went and begged Him to come down and heal his son, who was about to die.
\b
\m
\v 48 Jesus said to him, \wj “Unless you people see signs and wonders, you will never believe.”\wj*
\b
\m
\v 49 “Sir,” the official said, “come down before my child dies.”
\b
\m
\v 50 \wj “Go,”\wj* said Jesus. \wj “Your son will live.” \wj*
\b
\m The man took Jesus at His word and departed.
\v 51 And while he was still on the way, his servants met him with the news that his boy was alive.
\b
\m
\v 52 So he inquired as to the hour when his son had recovered, and they told him, “The fever left him yesterday at the seventh hour.\f + \fr 4:52 \ft That is, one in the afternoon\f*”
\b
\m
\v 53 Then the father realized that this was the very hour in which Jesus had told him, \wj “Your son will live.”\wj* And he and all his household believed.
\b
\m
\v 54 This was now the second sign that Jesus performed after coming from Judea into Galilee.
\c 5
\s1 The Pool of Bethesda
\b
\m 
\v 1 Some time later there was a feast of the Jews, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem. 
\b
\m 
\v 2 Now there is in Jerusalem near the Sheep Gate a pool with five covered colonnades, which in Hebrew \f + \fr 5:2 \ft Or in Aramaic\f* is called Bethesda.\f + \fr 5:2 \ft NA, NE, and WH Bethzatha\f* 
\v 3 On these walkways \f + \fr 5:3 \ft Literally In these\f* lay a great number of the sick, the blind, the lame, and the paralyzed.\f + \fr 5:3 \ft NE, BYZ, and TR include awaiting the moving of the waters. 4 For from time to time an angel descended into the pool and stirred the water. As soon as it was stirred, the first to enter the pool would be healed of his disease.\f* 
\b
\m 
\v 5 One man there had been an invalid for thirty-eight years. 
\v 6 When Jesus saw him lying there and realized that he had spent a long time in this condition, He asked him, \wj “Do you want to get well?”\wj* 
\b
\m 
\v 7 “Sir,” the invalid replied, “I have no one to help me into the pool when the water is stirred. While I am on my way, someone else goes in before me.” 
\b
\m 
\v 8 Then Jesus told him, \wj “Get up, pick up your mat, and walk.”\wj* 
\b
\m 
\v 9 Immediately the man was made well, and he picked up his mat and began to walk. 
\b
\m Now this happened on the Sabbath day, 
\v 10 so the Jews said to the man who had been healed, “This is the Sabbath! It is unlawful for you to carry your mat.” 
\b
\m 
\v 11 But he answered, “The man who made me well told me, \wj ‘Pick up your mat and walk.’\wj*” 
\b
\m 
\v 12 “Who is this man who told you to pick it up and walk?” they asked. 
\b
\m 
\v 13 But the man who was healed did not know who it was, for Jesus had slipped away while the crowd was there. 
\b
\m 
\v 14 Afterward, Jesus found the man at the temple and said to him, \wj “See, you have been made well. Stop sinning, or something worse may happen to you.”\wj* 
\b
\m 
\v 15 And the man went away and told the Jews that it was Jesus who had made him well. 
\s1 The Father and the Son
\b
\m 
\v 16 Now because Jesus was doing these things on the Sabbath, the Jews began to persecute Him. 
\v 17 But Jesus answered them, \wj “To this very day My Father is at His work, and I too am working.”\wj* 
\b
\m 
\v 18 Because of this, the Jews tried all the harder to kill Him. Not only was He breaking the Sabbath, but He was even calling God His own Father, making Himself equal with God. 
\b
\m 
\v 19 So Jesus replied, \wj “Truly, truly, I tell you, the Son can do nothing by Himself, unless He sees the Father doing it. For whatever the Father does, the Son also does.\wj* 
\v 20 \wj The Father loves the Son and shows Him all He does. And to your amazement, He will show Him even greater works than these.\wj* 
\v 21 \wj For just as the Father raises the dead and gives them life, so also the Son gives life to whom He wishes.\wj* 
\b
\m 
\v 22 \wj Furthermore, the Father judges no one, but has assigned all judgment to the Son,\wj* 
\v 23 \wj so that all may honor the Son just as they honor the Father. Whoever does not honor the Son does not honor the Father who sent Him.\wj* 
\b
\m 
\v 24 \wj Truly, truly, I tell you, whoever hears My word and believes Him who sent Me has eternal life and will not come under judgment. Indeed, he has crossed over from death to life.\wj* 
\b
\m 
\v 25 \wj Truly, truly, I tell you, the hour is coming and has now come when the dead will hear the voice of the Son of God, and those who hear will live.\wj* 
\v 26 \wj For as the Father has life in Himself, so also He has granted the Son to have life in Himself.\wj* 
\v 27 \wj And He has given Him authority to execute judgment, because He is the Son of Man.\wj* 
\b
\m 
\v 28 \wj Do not be amazed at this, for the hour is coming when all who are in their graves will hear His voice\wj* 
\v 29 \wj and come out—those who have done good to the resurrection of life, and those who have done evil to the resurrection of judgment.\wj*\f + \fr 5:29 \ft See Daniel 12:2.\f* 
\b
\m 
\v 30 \wj I can do nothing by Myself; I judge only as I hear. And My judgment is just, because I do not seek My own will, but the will of Him who sent Me.\wj* 
\s1 Testimonies about Jesus
\b
\m 
\v 31 \wj If I testify about Myself, My testimony is not valid.\wj* 
\v 32 \wj There is another who testifies about Me, and I know that His testimony about Me is valid.\wj* 
\b
\m 
\v 33 \wj You have sent to John, and he has testified to the truth.\wj* 
\v 34 \wj Even though I do not accept human testimony, I say these things so that you may be saved.\wj* 
\b
\m 
\v 35 \wj John was a lamp that burned and gave light, and you were willing for a season to bask in his light.\wj* 
\v 36 \wj But I have testimony more substantial than that of John. For the works that the Father has given Me to accomplish—the very works I am doing—testify about Me that the Father has sent Me.\wj* 
\v 37 \wj And the Father who sent Me has Himself testified about Me. You have never heard His voice nor seen His form,\wj* 
\v 38 \wj nor does His word abide in you, because you do not believe the One He sent.\wj* 
\s1 The Witness of Scripture
\r (Luke 16:19–31)
\b
\m 
\v 39 \wj You pore over the Scriptures because you presume that by them you possess eternal life. These are the very words that testify about Me,\wj* 
\v 40 \wj yet you refuse to come to Me to have life.\wj* 
\b
\m 
\v 41 \wj I do not accept glory from men,\wj* 
\v 42 \wj but I know you, that you do not have the love of God within you.\wj* 
\v 43 \wj I have come in My Father’s name, and you have not received Me; but if someone else comes in his own name, you will receive him.\wj* 
\v 44 \wj How can you believe if you accept glory from one another, yet do not seek the glory that comes from the only God?\wj* 
\b
\m 
\v 45 \wj Do not think that I will accuse you before the Father. Your accuser is Moses, in whom you have put your hope.\wj* 
\v 46 \wj If you had believed Moses, you would believe Me, because he wrote about Me.\wj* 
\v 47 \wj But since you do not believe what he wrote, how will you believe what I say?”\wj* 
\c 6
\s1 The Feeding of the Five Thousand
\r (Matthew 14:13–21; Mark 6:30–44; Luke 9:10–17)
\b
\m 
\v 1 After this, Jesus crossed to the other side of the Sea of Galilee (that is, the Sea of Tiberias). 
\v 2 A large crowd followed Him because they saw the signs He was performing on the sick. 
\v 3 Then Jesus went up on the mountain and sat down with His disciples. 
\b
\m 
\v 4 Now the Jewish Feast of the Passover was near. 
\v 5 When Jesus looked up and saw a large crowd coming toward Him, He said to Philip, \wj “Where can we buy bread for these people to eat?”\wj* 
\v 6 But He was asking this to test him, for He knew what He was about to do. 
\b
\m 
\v 7 Philip answered, “Two hundred denarii \f + \fr 6:7 \ft A denarius was customarily a day’s wage for a laborer; see Matthew 20:2.\f* would not buy enough bread for each of them to have a small piece.” 
\b
\m 
\v 8 One of His disciples, Andrew, Simon Peter’s brother, said to Him, 
\v 9 “Here is a boy with five barley loaves and two small fish. But what difference will these make among so many?” 
\b
\m 
\v 10 \wj “Have the people sit down,”\wj* Jesus said. Now there was plenty of grass in that place, so the men sat down, about five thousand of them. 
\b
\m 
\v 11 Then Jesus took the loaves and the fish, gave thanks, and distributed to those who were seated as much as they wanted. 
\b
\m 
\v 12 And when everyone was full, He said to His disciples, \wj “Gather the pieces that are left over, so that nothing will be wasted.”\wj* 
\b
\m 
\v 13 So they collected them and filled twelve baskets with the pieces of the five barley loaves left over by those who had eaten. 
\b
\m 
\v 14 When the people saw the sign that Jesus had performed,\f + \fr 6:14 \ft SBL, NA, NE, and WH He had performed\f* they began to say, “Truly this is the Prophet who is to come into the world.” 
\b
\m 
\v 15 Then Jesus, realizing that they were about to come and make Him king by force, withdrew again to a mountain by Himself. 
\s1 Jesus Walks on Water
\r (Matthew 14:22–33; Mark 6:45–52)
\b
\m 
\v 16 When evening came, His disciples went down to the sea, 
\v 17 got into a boat, and started across the sea to Capernaum. It was already dark, and Jesus had not yet gone out to them. 
\v 18 A strong wind was blowing, and the sea grew agitated. 
\b
\m 
\v 19 When they had rowed about three or four miles,\f + \fr 6:19 \ft Greek about twenty-five or thirty stadia; that is, approximately 2.87 to 3.45 miles (4.62 to 5.55 kilometers)\f* they saw Jesus approaching the boat, walking on the sea—and they were terrified. 
\v 20 But Jesus spoke up: \wj “It is I; do not be afraid.”\wj* 
\v 21 Then they were willing to take Him into the boat, and at once the boat reached the shore where they were heading. 
\s1 Jesus the Bread of Life
\b
\m 
\v 22 The next day, the crowd that had remained on the other side of the sea realized that only one boat had been there, and that Jesus had not boarded it with His disciples, but they had gone away alone. 
\v 23 However, some boats from Tiberias landed near the place where the people had eaten the bread after the Lord had given thanks. 
\v 24 So when the crowd saw that neither Jesus nor His disciples were there, they got into the boats and went to Capernaum to look for Him. 
\v 25 When they found Him on the other side of the sea, they asked Him, “Rabbi, when did You get here?” 
\b
\m 
\v 26 Jesus replied, \wj “Truly, truly, I tell you, it is not because you saw these signs that you are looking for Me, but because you ate the loaves and had your fill.\wj* 
\v 27 \wj Do not work for food that perishes, but for food that endures to eternal life, which the Son of Man will give you. For on Him God the Father has placed His seal of approval.”\wj* 
\b
\m 
\v 28 Then they inquired, “What must we do to perform the works of God?” 
\b
\m 
\v 29 Jesus replied, \wj “The work of God is this: to believe in the One He has sent.”\wj* 
\b
\m 
\v 30 So they asked Him, “What sign then will You perform, so that we may see it and believe You? What will You do? 
\v 31 Our fathers ate the manna in the wilderness, as it is written: ‘He gave them bread from heaven to eat.’\f + \fr 6:31 \ft Psalm 78:24; see also Exodus 16:4.\f*” 
\b
\m 
\v 32 Jesus said to them, \wj “Truly, truly, I tell you, it was not Moses who gave you the bread from heaven, but it is My Father who gives you the true bread from heaven.\wj* 
\v 33 \wj For the bread of God is He who comes down from heaven and gives life to the world.”\wj* 
\b
\m 
\v 34 “Sir,” they said, “give us this bread at all times.” 
\b
\m 
\v 35 Jesus answered, \wj “I am the bread of life. Whoever comes to Me will never hunger, and whoever believes in Me will never thirst.\wj* 
\v 36 \wj But as I stated, you have seen Me and still you do not believe.\wj* 
\b
\m 
\v 37 \wj Everyone the Father gives Me will come to Me, and the one who comes to Me I will never drive away.\wj* 
\v 38 \wj For I have come down from heaven, not to do My own will, but to do the will of Him who sent Me.\wj* 
\b
\m 
\v 39 \wj And this is the will of Him who sent Me, that I shall lose none of those He has given Me, but raise them up at the last day.\wj* 
\v 40 \wj For it is My Father’s will that everyone who looks to the Son and believes in Him shall have eternal life, and I will raise him up at the last day.”\wj* 
\b
\m 
\v 41 At this, the Jews began to grumble about Jesus because He had said, \wj “I am the bread that came down from heaven.”\wj* 
\v 42 They were asking, “Is this not Jesus, the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know? How then can He say, \wj ‘I have come down from heaven?’\wj*” 
\b
\m 
\v 43 \wj “Stop grumbling among yourselves,”\wj* Jesus replied. 
\v 44 \wj “No one can come to Me unless the Father who sent Me draws him, and I will raise him up at the last day.\wj* 
\v 45 \wj It is written in the Prophets: ‘And they will all be taught by God.’\wj*\f + \fr 6:45 \ft Isaiah 54:13\f*\wj Everyone who has heard the Father and learned from Him comes to Me—\wj*
\v 46 \wj not that anyone has seen the Father except the One who is from God; only He has seen the Father.\wj* 
\b
\m 
\v 47 \wj Truly, truly, I tell you, he who believes has eternal life.\wj* 
\v 48 \wj I am the bread of life.\wj* 
\v 49 \wj Your fathers ate the manna in the wilderness, yet they died.\wj* 
\v 50 \wj This is the bread that comes down from heaven, so that anyone may eat of it and not die.\wj* 
\v 51 \wj I am the living bread that came down from heaven. If anyone eats of this bread, he will live forever. And this bread, which I will give for the life of the world, is My flesh.”\wj* 
\b
\m 
\v 52 At this, the Jews began to argue among themselves, “How can this man give us His flesh to eat?” 
\b
\m 
\v 53 So Jesus said to them, \wj “Truly, truly, I tell you, unless you eat the flesh and drink the blood of the Son of Man, you have no life in you.\wj* 
\v 54 \wj Whoever eats My flesh and drinks My blood has eternal life, and I will raise him up at the last day.\wj* 
\v 55 \wj For My flesh is real food, and My blood is real drink.\wj* 
\b
\m 
\v 56 \wj Whoever eats My flesh and drinks My blood remains in Me, and I in him.\wj* 
\v 57 \wj Just as the living Father sent Me and I live because of the Father, so also the one who feeds on Me will live because of Me.\wj* 
\v 58 \wj This is the bread that came down from heaven. Unlike your fathers, who ate the manna and died, the one who eats this bread will live forever.”\wj* 
\s1 Many Disciples Turn Back
\r (Matthew 8:18–22; Luke 9:57–62; Luke 14:25–33)
\b
\m 
\v 59 Jesus said this while teaching in the synagogue in Capernaum. 
\v 60 On hearing it, many of His disciples said, “This is a difficult teaching. Who can accept it?” 
\b
\m 
\v 61 Aware that His disciples were grumbling about this teaching, Jesus asked them, \wj “Does this offend you?\wj* 
\v 62 \wj Then what will happen if you see the Son of Man ascend to where He was before?\wj* 
\b
\m 
\v 63 \wj The Spirit gives life; the flesh profits nothing. The words I have spoken to you are spirit and they are life.\wj* 
\v 64 \wj However, there are some of you who do not believe.”\wj* (For Jesus had known from the beginning which of them did not believe and who would betray Him.) 
\b
\m 
\v 65 Then Jesus said, \wj “This is why I told you that no one can come to Me unless the Father has granted it to him.”\wj* 
\b
\m 
\v 66 From that time on many of His disciples turned back and no longer walked with Him. 
\s1 Peter’s Confession of Faith
\r (Matthew 16:13–20; Mark 8:27–30; Luke 9:18–20)
\b
\m 
\v 67 So Jesus asked the Twelve, \wj “Do you want to leave too?”\wj* 
\b
\m 
\v 68 Simon Peter replied, “Lord, to whom would we go? You have the words of eternal life. 
\v 69 We believe and know that You are the Holy One of God.\f + \fr 6:69 \ft BYZ and TR You are the Christ, the Son of the living God\f*” 
\b
\m 
\v 70 Jesus answered them, \wj “Have I not chosen you, the Twelve? Yet one of you is a devil!”\wj* 
\v 71 He was speaking about Judas, the son of Simon Iscariot. For although Judas was one of the Twelve, he was later to betray Jesus. 
\c 7
\s1 Jesus Teaches at the Feast
\b
\m 
\v 1 After this, Jesus traveled throughout Galilee. He did not want to travel in Judea, because the Jews there were trying to kill Him. 
\v 2 However, the Jewish Feast of Tabernacles \f + \fr 7:2 \ft That is, Sukkot, the autumn feast of pilgrimage to Jerusalem; also translated as the Feast of Booths or the Feast of Shelters and originally called the Feast of Ingathering (see Exodus 23:16 and Exodus 34:22).\f* was near. 
\v 3 So Jesus’ brothers said to Him, “Leave here and go to Judea, so that Your disciples there may see the works You are doing. 
\v 4 For no one who wants to be known publicly acts in secret. Since You are doing these things, show Yourself to the world.” 
\v 5 For even His own brothers did not believe in Him. 
\b
\m 
\v 6 Therefore Jesus told them, \wj “Although your time is always at hand, My time has not yet come.\wj* 
\v 7 \wj The world cannot hate you, but it hates Me, because I testify that its works are evil.\wj* 
\v 8 \wj Go up to the feast on your own. I am not\wj* \f + \fr 7:8 \ft NE, WH, BYZ, and TR I am not yet\f*\wj going up to this feast, because My time has not yet come.”\wj* 
\b
\m 
\v 9 Having said this, Jesus remained in Galilee. 
\v 10 But after His brothers had gone up to the feast, He also went—not publicly, but in secret. 
\b
\m 
\v 11 So the Jews were looking for Him at the feast and asking, “Where is He?” 
\b
\m 
\v 12 Many in the crowds were whispering about Him. Some said, “He is a good man.” 
\b
\m But others replied, “No, He deceives the people.” 
\b
\m 
\v 13 Yet no one would speak publicly about Him for fear of the Jews. 
\b
\m 
\v 14 About halfway through the feast, Jesus went up to the temple courts \f + \fr 7:14 \ft Literally the temple; also in verse 28\f* and began to teach. 
\v 15 The Jews were amazed and asked, “How did this man attain such learning without having studied?” 
\b
\m 
\v 16 \wj “My teaching is not My own,”\wj* Jesus replied. \wj “It comes from Him who sent Me.\wj* 
\v 17 \wj If anyone desires to do His will, he will know whether My teaching is from God or whether I speak on My own.\wj* 
\v 18 \wj He who speaks on his own authority seeks his own glory, but He who seeks the glory of the One who sent Him is a man of truth; in Him there is no falsehood.\wj* 
\v 19 \wj Has not Moses given you the law? Yet not one of you keeps it. Why are you trying to kill Me?”\wj* 
\b
\m 
\v 20 “You have a demon,” the crowd replied. “Who is trying to kill You?” 
\b
\m 
\v 21 Jesus answered them, \wj “I did one miracle, and you are all amazed.\wj* 
\v 22 \wj But because Moses gave you circumcision, you circumcise a boy on the Sabbath (not that it is from Moses, but from the patriarchs.)\wj* 
\v 23 \wj If a boy can be circumcised on the Sabbath so that the law of Moses will not be broken, why are you angry with Me for making the whole man well on the Sabbath?\wj* 
\v 24 \wj Stop judging by outward appearances, and start judging justly.”\wj* 
\s1 Is Jesus the Christ?
\b
\m 
\v 25 Then some of the people of Jerusalem began to say, “Isn’t this the man they are trying to kill? 
\v 26 Yet here He is, speaking publicly, and they are not saying anything to Him. Have the rulers truly recognized that this is the Christ? 
\v 27 But we know where this man is from. When the Christ comes, no one will know where He is from.” 
\b
\m 
\v 28 Then Jesus, still teaching in the temple courts, cried out, \wj “You know Me, and you know where I am from. I have not come of My own accord, but He who sent Me is true. You do not know Him,\wj* 
\v 29 \wj but I know Him, because I am from Him and He sent Me.”\wj* 
\b
\m 
\v 30 So they tried to seize Him, but no one laid a hand on Him, because His hour had not yet come. 
\v 31 Many in the crowd, however, believed in Him and said, “When the Christ comes, will He perform more signs than this man?” 
\b
\m 
\v 32 When the Pharisees heard the crowd whispering these things about Jesus, they and the chief priests sent officers to arrest Him. 
\v 33 So Jesus said, \wj “I am with you only a little while longer, and then I am going to the One who sent Me.\wj* 
\v 34 \wj You will look for Me, but you will not find Me; and where I am, you cannot come.”\wj* 
\b
\m 
\v 35 At this, the Jews said to one another, “Where does He intend to go that we will not find Him? Will He go where the Jews are dispersed among the Greeks,\f + \fr 7:35 \ft Literally Will He go to the Diaspora among the Greeks; the Jewish people living outside the land of Israel since the Babylonian exile were referred to as the Diaspora.\f* and teach the Greeks? 
\v 36 What does He mean by saying, \wj ‘You will look for Me, but you will not find Me,’\wj* and, \wj ‘Where I am, you cannot come’\wj*?” 
\s1 Living Water
\b
\m 
\v 37 On the last and greatest day of the feast, Jesus stood up and called out in a loud voice, \wj “If anyone is thirsty, let him come to Me and drink.\wj* 
\v 38 \wj Whoever believes in Me, as the Scripture has said: ‘Streams of living water will flow from within him.’”\wj* 
\v 39 He was speaking about the Spirit, whom those who believed in Him were later to receive. For the Spirit had not yet been given,\f + \fr 7:39 \ft Literally the Spirit was not yet; BYZ and TR the Holy Spirit was not yet\f* because Jesus had not yet been glorified. 
\s1 Division over Jesus
\b
\m 
\v 40 On hearing these words, some of the people said, “This is truly the Prophet.” 
\b
\m 
\v 41 Others declared, “This is the Christ.” 
\b
\m But still others asked, “How can the Christ come from Galilee? 
\v 42 Doesn’t the Scripture say that the Christ will come from the line of David and from Bethlehem, the village where David lived?\f + \fr 7:42 \ft See Micah 5:2.\f*” 
\b
\m 
\v 43 So there was division in the crowd because of Jesus. 
\v 44 Some of them wanted to seize Him, but no one laid a hand on Him. 
\s1 The Unbelief of the Jewish Leaders
\b
\m 
\v 45 Then the officers returned to the chief priests and Pharisees, who asked them, “Why didn’t you bring Him in?” 
\b
\m 
\v 46 “Never has anyone spoken like this man!” the officers answered. 
\b
\m 
\v 47 “Have you also been deceived?” replied the Pharisees. 
\v 48 “Have any of the rulers or Pharisees believed in Him? 
\v 49 But this crowd that does not know the law, they are under a curse.” 
\b
\m 
\v 50 Nicodemus, who had gone to Jesus earlier and who himself was one of them, asked, 
\v 51 “Does our law convict a man without first hearing from him to determine what he has done?” 
\b
\m 
\v 52 “Aren’t you also from Galilee?” they replied. “Look into it, and you will see that no prophet comes out of Galilee.”\f + \fr 7:52 \ft Early manuscripts do not include John 7:53 through John 8:11.\f* 
\b
\m 
\v 53 Then each went to his own home. 
\c 8
\s1 The Woman Caught in Adultery
\b
\m
\v 1 But Jesus went to the Mount of Olives.
\b
\m
\v 2 Early in the morning He went back into the temple courts.\f + \fr 8:2 \ft Literally the temple; also in verse 20\f* All the people came to Him, and He sat down to teach them.
\v 3 The scribes and Pharisees, however, brought to Him a woman caught in adultery. They made her stand before them
\v 4 and said, “Teacher, this woman was caught in the act of adultery.
\v 5 In the Law Moses commanded us to stone such a woman. So what do You say?”
\b
\m
\v 6 They said this to test Him, in order to have a basis for accusing Him. But Jesus bent down and began to write on the ground with His finger.
\b
\m
\v 7 When they continued to question Him, He straightened up and said to them, \wj “Let him who is without sin among you be the first to cast a stone at her.”\wj*
\v 8 And again He bent down and wrote on the ground.
\b
\m
\v 9 When they heard this,\f + \fr 8:9 \ft NE, BYZ, and TR include and were convicted by their conscience,\f* they began to go away one by one, beginning with the older ones, until only Jesus was left, with the woman standing there.
\v 10 Then Jesus straightened up \f + \fr 8:10 \ft NE, BYZ, and TR include and saw no one but the woman.\f* and asked her, \wj “Woman, where are your accusers?\wj*\f + \fr 8:10 \ft WH and NA where are they\f*\wj Has no one condemned you?” \wj*
\b
\m
\v 11 “No one, Lord,” she answered.
\b
\m \wj “Then neither do I condemn you,”\wj* Jesus declared. \wj “Now go and sin no more.”\wj*
\s1 Jesus the Light of the World
\r (1 John 1:5–10)
\b
\m
\v 12 Once again, Jesus spoke to the people and said, \wj “I am the light of the world. Whoever follows Me will never walk in the darkness, but will have the light of life.”\wj*
\b
\m
\v 13 So the Pharisees said to Him, “You are testifying about Yourself; Your testimony is not valid.”
\b
\m
\v 14 Jesus replied, \wj “Even if I testify about Myself, My testimony is valid, because I know where I came from and where I am going. But you do not know where I came from or where I am going.\wj*
\v 15 \wj You judge according to the flesh; I judge no one.\wj*
\v 16 \wj But even if I do judge, My judgment is true, because I am not alone; I am with the Father who sent Me.\wj*\f + \fr 8:16 \ft Literally but (it is) I and the Father who sent Me; NE but (it is) I and the One who sent Me\f*
\v 17 \wj Even in your own Law it is written that the testimony of two men is valid.\wj*\f + \fr 8:17 \ft See Deuteronomy 19:15.\f*
\v 18 \wj I am One who testifies about Myself, and the Father, who sent Me, also testifies about Me.”\wj*
\b
\m
\v 19 “Where is Your Father?” they asked Him.
\b
\m \wj “You do not know Me or My Father,”\wj* Jesus answered. \wj “If you knew Me, you would know My Father as well.”\wj*
\b
\m
\v 20 He spoke these words while teaching in the temple courts, near the treasury. Yet no one seized Him, because His hour had not yet come.
\b
\m
\v 21 Again He said to them, \wj “I am going away, and you will look for Me, but you will die in your sin. Where I am going, you cannot come.”\wj*
\b
\m
\v 22 So the Jews began to ask, “Will He kill Himself, since He says, \wj ‘Where I am going, you cannot come’\wj*?”
\b
\m
\v 23 Then He told them, \wj “You are from below; I am from above. You are of this world; I am not of this world.\wj*
\v 24 \wj That is why I told you that you would die in your sins. For unless you believe that I am He, you will die in your sins.”\wj*
\b
\m
\v 25 “Who are You?” they asked.
\b
\m \wj “Just what I have been telling you from the beginning,”\wj* Jesus replied.
\v 26 \wj “I have much to say about you and much to judge. But the One who sent Me is truthful, and what I have heard from Him, I tell the world.”\wj*
\b
\m
\v 27 They did not understand that He was telling them about the Father.
\v 28 So Jesus said, \wj “When you have lifted up the Son of Man, then you will know that I am He, and that I do nothing on My own, but speak exactly what the Father has taught Me.\wj*
\v 29 \wj He who sent Me is with Me. He has not left Me alone, because I always do what pleases Him.”\wj*
\s1 The Truth Will Set You Free
\r (2 John 1:4–6)
\b
\m
\v 30 As Jesus spoke these things, many believed in Him.
\v 31 So He said to the Jews who had believed Him, \wj “If you continue in My word, you are truly My disciples.\wj*
\v 32 \wj Then you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free.”\wj*
\b
\m
\v 33 “We are Abraham’s descendants,” they answered. “We have never been slaves to anyone. How can You say we will be set free?”
\b
\m
\v 34 Jesus replied, \wj “Truly, truly, I tell you, everyone who sins is a slave to sin.\wj*
\v 35 \wj A slave is not a permanent member of the family, but a son belongs to it forever.\wj*
\v 36 \wj So if the Son sets you free, you will be free indeed.\wj*
\b
\m
\v 37 \wj I know you are Abraham’s descendants, but you are trying to kill Me because My word has no place within you.\wj*
\v 38 \wj I speak of what I have seen in the presence of the Father, and you do what you have heard from your father.”\wj*
\b
\m
\v 39 “Abraham is our father,” they replied.
\b
\m \wj “If you were children of Abraham,”\wj* said Jesus, \wj “you would do the works of Abraham.\wj*
\v 40 \wj But now you are trying to kill Me, a man who has told you the truth that I heard from God. Abraham never did such a thing.\wj*
\v 41 \wj You are doing the works of your father.”\wj*
\b
\m “We are not illegitimate children,” they declared. “Our only Father is God Himself.”
\b
\m
\v 42 Jesus said to them, \wj “If God were your Father, you would love Me, for I have come here from God. I have not come on My own, but He sent Me.\wj*
\b
\m
\v 43 \wj Why do you not understand what I am saying? It is because you are unable to accept My message.\wj*
\v 44 \wj You belong to your father, the devil, and you want to carry out his desires. He was a murderer from the beginning, refusing to uphold the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he lies, he speaks his native language, because he is a liar and the father of lies.\wj*
\v 45 \wj But because I speak the truth, you do not believe Me!\wj*
\b
\m
\v 46 \wj Which of you can prove Me guilty of sin? If I speak the truth, why do you not believe Me?\wj*
\v 47 \wj Whoever belongs to God hears the words of God. The reason you do not hear is that you do not belong to God.”\wj*
\s1 Before Abraham Was Born, I Am
\b
\m
\v 48 The Jews answered Him, “Are we not right to say that You are a Samaritan and You have a demon?”
\b
\m
\v 49 \wj “I do not have a demon,”\wj* Jesus replied, \wj “but I honor My Father, and you dishonor Me.\wj*
\v 50 \wj I do not seek My own glory. There is One who seeks it, and He is the Judge.\wj*
\v 51 \wj Truly, truly, I tell you, if anyone keeps My word, he will never see death.”\wj*
\b
\m
\v 52 “Now we know that You have a demon!” declared the Jews. “Abraham died, and so did the prophets, yet You say that anyone who keeps Your word will never taste death.
\v 53 Are You greater than our father Abraham? He died, as did the prophets. Who do You claim to be?”
\b
\m
\v 54 Jesus answered, \wj “If I glorify Myself, My glory means nothing. The One who glorifies Me is My Father, of whom you say ‘He is our\wj* \f + \fr 8:54 \ft WH and TR Your\f*\wj God.’\wj*
\v 55 \wj You do not know Him, but I know Him. If I said I did not know Him, I would be a liar like you. But I do know Him, and I keep His word.\wj*
\v 56 \wj Your father Abraham rejoiced that he would see My day. He saw it and was glad.”\wj*
\b
\m
\v 57 Then the Jews said to Him, “You are not yet fifty years old, and You have seen Abraham?”
\b
\m
\v 58 \wj “Truly, truly, I tell you,”\wj* Jesus declared, \wj “before Abraham was born, I am!\wj*\f + \fr 8:58 \ft Literally before Abraham was, I am!\f*\wj ”\wj*
\b
\m
\v 59 At this, they picked up stones to throw at Him. But Jesus was hidden and went out of the temple area.\f + \fr 8:59 \ft BYZ and TR include going through the midst of them, and so He passed by.\f*
\c 9
\s1 Jesus Heals the Man Born Blind
\b
\m 
\v 1 Now as Jesus was passing by, He saw a man blind from birth, 
\v 2 and His disciples asked Him, “Rabbi, who sinned, this man or his parents, that he was born blind?” 
\b
\m 
\v 3 Jesus answered, \wj “Neither this man nor his parents sinned, but this happened so that the works of God would be displayed in him.\wj* 
\v 4 \wj While it is daytime, we must do\wj* \f + \fr 9:4 \ft BYZ and TR I must do\f*\wj the works of Him who sent Me. Night is coming, when no one can work.\wj* 
\v 5 \wj While I am in the world, I am the light of the world.”\wj* 
\b
\m 
\v 6 When Jesus had said this, He spit on the ground, made some mud, and applied it to the man’s eyes. 
\v 7 Then He told him, \wj “Go, wash in the Pool of Siloam”\wj* (which means “Sent”). So the man went and washed, and came back seeing. 
\b
\m 
\v 8 At this, his neighbors and those who had formerly seen him begging began to ask, “Isn’t this the man who used to sit and beg?” 
\b
\m 
\v 9 Some claimed that he was, but others said, “No, he just looks like him.” 
\b
\m But the man kept saying, “I am the one.” 
\b
\m 
\v 10 “How then were your eyes opened?” they asked. 
\b
\m 
\v 11 He answered, “The man they call Jesus made some mud and anointed my eyes, and He told me to go to Siloam and wash. So I went and washed and received my sight.” 
\b
\m 
\v 12 “Where is He?” they asked. 
\b
\m “I do not know,” he answered. 
\s1 The Pharisees Investigate the Healing
\b
\m 
\v 13 They brought to the Pharisees the man who had been blind. 
\v 14 Now the day on which Jesus had made the mud and opened his eyes was a Sabbath. 
\v 15 So the Pharisees also asked him how he had received his sight. 
\b
\m The man answered, “He put mud on my eyes, and I washed, and now I can see.” 
\b
\m 
\v 16 Because of this, some of the Pharisees said, “This man is not from God, for He does not keep the Sabbath.” 
\b
\m But others said, “How can a sinful man perform such signs?” 
\b
\m And there was division among them. 
\v 17 So once again they asked the man who had been blind, “What do you say about Him, since it was your eyes He opened?” 
\b
\m “He is a prophet,” the man replied. 
\b
\m 
\v 18 The Jews still did not believe that the man had been blind and had received his sight until they summoned his parents 
\v 19 and asked, “Is this your son, the one you say was born blind? So how is it that he can now see?” 
\b
\m 
\v 20 His parents answered, “We know he is our son, and we know he was born blind. 
\v 21 But how he can now see or who opened his eyes, we do not know. Ask him. He is old enough to speak for himself.” 
\b
\m 
\v 22 His parents said this because they were afraid of the Jews. For the Jews had already determined that anyone who confessed Jesus as the Christ would be put out of the synagogue. 
\v 23 That was why his parents said, “He is old enough. Ask him.” 
\b
\m 
\v 24 So a second time they called for the man who had been blind and said, “Give glory to God! We know that this man is a sinner.” 
\b
\m 
\v 25 He answered, “Whether He is a sinner I do not know. There is one thing I do know: I was blind, but now I see!” 
\b
\m 
\v 26 “What did He do to you?” they asked. “How did He open your eyes?” 
\b
\m 
\v 27 He replied, “I already told you, and you did not listen. Why do you want to hear it again? Do you also want to become His disciples?” 
\b
\m 
\v 28 Then they heaped insults on him and said, “You are His disciple; we are disciples of Moses. 
\v 29 We know that God spoke to Moses, but we do not know where this man is from.” 
\b
\m 
\v 30 “That is remarkable indeed!” the man said. “You do not know where He is from, and yet He opened my eyes. 
\v 31 We know that God does not listen to sinners, but He does listen to the one who worships Him and does His will. 
\v 32 Never before has anyone heard of opening the eyes of a man born blind. 
\v 33 If this man were not from God, He could do no such thing.” 
\b
\m 
\v 34 They replied, “You were born in utter sin, and you are instructing us?” And they threw him out. 
\s1 Spiritual Blindness
\b
\m 
\v 35 When Jesus heard that they had thrown him out, He found the man and said, \wj “Do you believe in the Son of Man\wj* \f + \fr 9:35 \ft BYZ and TR the Son of God\f*\wj ?”\wj* 
\b
\m 
\v 36 “Who is He, Sir?” he replied. “Tell me so that I may believe in Him.” 
\b
\m 
\v 37 \wj “You have already seen Him,”\wj* Jesus answered. \wj “He is the One speaking with you.”\wj* 
\b
\m 
\v 38 “Lord, I believe,” he said. And he worshiped Jesus. 
\b
\m 
\v 39 Then Jesus declared, \wj “For judgment I have come into this world, so that the blind may see and those who see may become blind.”\wj*\f + \fr 9:39 \ft Literally so that those not seeing may see and those seeing may become blind. Some manuscripts do not include 38 “Lord, I believe.”... 39 Then Jesus declared.\f* 
\b
\m 
\v 40 Some of the Pharisees who were with Him heard this, and they asked Him, “Are we blind too?” 
\b
\m 
\v 41 \wj “If you were blind,”\wj* Jesus replied, \wj “you would not be guilty of sin. But since you claim you can see, your guilt remains.”\wj* 
\c 10
\s1 Jesus the Good Shepherd
\r (Psalm 23:1–6; Ezekiel 34:11–24)
\b
\m 
\v 1 \wj “Truly, truly, I tell you, whoever does not enter the sheepfold by the gate, but climbs in some other way, is a thief and a robber.\wj* 
\v 2 \wj But the one who enters by the gate is the shepherd of the sheep.\wj* 
\v 3 \wj The gatekeeper opens the gate for him, and the sheep listen for his voice. He calls his own sheep by name and leads them out.\wj* 
\b
\m 
\v 4 \wj When he has brought out all his own, he goes on ahead of them, and his sheep follow him because they know his voice.\wj* 
\v 5 \wj But they will never follow a stranger; in fact, they will flee from him because they do not recognize his voice.”\wj* 
\b
\m 
\v 6 Jesus spoke to them using this illustration, but they did not understand what He was telling them. 
\v 7 So He said to them again, \wj “Truly, truly, I tell you, I am the gate for the sheep.\wj* 
\v 8 \wj All who came before Me\wj* \f + \fr 10:8 \ft BYZ All who came\f*\wj were thieves and robbers, but the sheep did not listen to them.\wj* 
\v 9 \wj I am the gate. If anyone enters through Me, he will be saved. He will come in and go out and find pasture.\wj* 
\v 10 \wj The thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy. I have come that they may have life, and have it in all its fullness.\wj* 
\b
\m 
\v 11 \wj I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd lays down His life for the sheep.\wj* 
\v 12 \wj The hired hand is not the shepherd, and the sheep are not his own. When he sees the wolf coming, he abandons the sheep and runs away. Then the wolf pounces on them and scatters the flock.\wj* 
\v 13 \wj The man runs away because he is a hired servant and is unconcerned for the sheep.\wj* 
\b
\m 
\v 14 \wj I am the good shepherd. I know My sheep and My sheep know Me,\wj* 
\v 15 \wj just as the Father knows Me and I know the Father. And I lay down My life for the sheep.\wj* 
\v 16 \wj I have other sheep that are not of this fold. I must bring them in as well, and they will listen to My voice. Then there will be one flock and one shepherd.\wj* 
\b
\m 
\v 17 \wj The reason the Father loves Me is that I lay down My life in order to take it up again.\wj* 
\v 18 \wj No one takes it from Me, but I lay it down of My own accord. I have authority to lay it down and authority to take it up again. This charge I have received from My Father.”\wj* 
\b
\m 
\v 19 Again there was division among the Jews because of Jesus’ message. 
\v 20 Many of them said, “He is demon-possessed and insane. Why would you listen to Him?” 
\b
\m 
\v 21 But others replied, “These are not the words of a man possessed by a demon. Can a demon open the eyes of the blind?” 
\s1 Jesus at the Feast of Dedication
\b
\m 
\v 22 At that time the Feast of Dedication \f + \fr 10:22 \ft That is, Hanukkah, the historic celebration of the Maccabean Revolt and rededication of the temple\f* took place in Jerusalem. It was winter, 
\v 23 and Jesus was walking in the temple courts \f + \fr 10:23 \ft Literally the temple\f* in Solomon’s Colonnade. 
\v 24 So the Jews gathered around Him and demanded, “How long will You keep us in suspense? If You are the Christ, tell us plainly.” 
\b
\m 
\v 25 \wj “I already told you,”\wj* Jesus replied, \wj “but you did not believe. The works I do in My Father’s name testify on My behalf.\wj* 
\v 26 \wj But because you are not My sheep, you refuse to believe.\wj* 
\v 27 \wj My sheep listen to My voice; I know them, and they follow Me.\wj* 
\v 28 \wj I give them eternal life, and they will never perish. No one can snatch them out of My hand.\wj* 
\v 29 \wj My Father who has given them to Me is greater than all. No one can snatch them out of My Father’s hand.\wj* 
\v 30 \wj I and the Father are one.”\wj* 
\b
\m 
\v 31 At this, the Jews again picked up stones to stone Him. 
\v 32 But Jesus responded, \wj “I have shown you many good works from the Father. For which of these do you stone Me?”\wj* 
\b
\m 
\v 33 “We are not stoning You for any good work,” said the Jews, “but for blasphemy, because You, who are a man, declare Yourself to be God.” 
\b
\m 
\v 34 Jesus replied, \wj “Is it not written in your Law: ‘I have said you are gods’\wj*\f + \fr 10:34 \ft Psalm 82:6\f*\wj ?\wj* 
\v 35 \wj If he called them gods to whom the word of God came—and the Scripture cannot be broken—\wj*
\v 36 \wj then what about the One whom the Father sanctified and sent into the world? How then can you accuse Me of blasphemy for stating that I am the Son of God?\wj* 
\b
\m 
\v 37 \wj If I am not doing the works of My Father, then do not believe Me.\wj* 
\v 38 \wj But if I am doing them, even though you do not believe Me, believe the works themselves, so that you may know and understand that the Father is in Me, and I am in the Father.”\wj* 
\b
\m 
\v 39 At this, they tried again to seize Him, but He escaped their grasp. 
\s1 John’s Testimony Confirmed
\b
\m 
\v 40 Then Jesus went back across the Jordan to the place where John had first been baptizing, and He stayed there. 
\v 41 Many came to Him and said, “Although John never performed a sign, everything he said about this man was true.” 
\v 42 And many in that place believed in Jesus. 
\c 11
\s1 The Death of Lazarus
\b
\m 
\v 1 At this time a man named Lazarus was sick. He lived in Bethany, the village of Mary and her sister Martha. 
\v 2 (Mary, whose brother Lazarus was sick, was to anoint the Lord with perfume and wipe His feet \f + \fr 11:2 \ft Literally was the one having anointed the Lord with fragrant oil and having wiped His feet; see John 12:3.\f* with her hair.) 
\v 3 So the sisters sent word to Jesus, “Lord, the one You love is sick.” 
\b
\m 
\v 4 When Jesus heard this, He said, \wj “This sickness will not end in death. No, it is for the glory of God, so that the Son of God may be glorified through it.”\wj* 
\b
\m 
\v 5 Now Jesus loved Martha and her sister and Lazarus. 
\v 6 So on hearing that Lazarus was sick, He stayed where He was for two days, 
\v 7 and then He said to the disciples, \wj “Let us go back to Judea.”\wj* 
\b
\m 
\v 8 “Rabbi,” they replied, “the Jews just tried to stone You, and You are going back there?” 
\b
\m 
\v 9 Jesus answered, \wj “Are there not twelve hours of daylight? If anyone walks in the daytime, he will not stumble, because he sees by the light of this world.\wj* 
\v 10 \wj But if anyone walks at night, he will stumble, because he has no light.”\wj* 
\b
\m 
\v 11 After He had said this, He told them, \wj “Our friend Lazarus has fallen asleep, but I am going there to wake him up.”\wj* 
\b
\m 
\v 12 His disciples replied, “Lord, if he is sleeping, he will get better.” 
\v 13 They thought that Jesus was talking about actual sleep, but He was speaking about the death of Lazarus. 
\b
\m 
\v 14 So Jesus told them plainly, \wj “Lazarus is dead,\wj* 
\v 15 \wj and for your sake I am glad I was not there, so that you may believe. But let us go to him.”\wj* 
\b
\m 
\v 16 Then Thomas called Didymus \f + \fr 11:16 \ft Didymus means the twin.\f* said to his fellow disciples, “Let us also go, so that we may die with Him.” 
\s1 Jesus Comforts Martha and Mary
\b
\m 
\v 17 When Jesus arrived, He found that Lazarus had already spent four days in the tomb. 
\v 18 Now Bethany was near Jerusalem, a little less than two miles \f + \fr 11:18 \ft Greek about fifteen stadia; that is, approximately 1.72 miles or 2.78 kilometers\f* away, 
\v 19 and many of the Jews had come to Martha and Mary to console them in the loss of their brother. 
\v 20 So when Martha heard that Jesus was coming, she went out to meet Him; but Mary stayed at home. 
\b
\m 
\v 21 Martha said to Jesus, “Lord, if You had been here, my brother would not have died. 
\v 22 But even now I know that God will give You whatever You ask of Him.” 
\b
\m 
\v 23 \wj “Your brother will rise again,”\wj* Jesus told her. 
\b
\m 
\v 24 Martha replied, “I know that he will rise again in the resurrection at the last day.” 
\b
\m 
\v 25 Jesus said to her, \wj “I am the resurrection and the life. Whoever believes in Me will live, even though he dies.\wj* 
\v 26 \wj And everyone who lives and believes in Me will never die. Do you believe this?”\wj* 
\b
\m 
\v 27 “Yes, Lord,” she answered, “I believe that You are the Christ, the Son of God, who was to come into the world.” 
\b
\m 
\v 28 After Martha had said this, she went back and called her sister Mary aside to tell her, “The Teacher is here and is asking for you.” 
\v 29 And when Mary heard this, she got up quickly and went to Him. 
\b
\m 
\v 30 Now Jesus had not yet entered the village, but was still at the place where Martha had met Him. 
\v 31 When the Jews who were in the house consoling Mary saw how quickly she got up and went out, they followed her, supposing she was going to the tomb to mourn there. 
\v 32 When Mary came to Jesus and saw Him, she fell at His feet and said, “Lord, if You had been here, my brother would not have died.” 
\b
\m 
\v 33 When Jesus saw her weeping, and the Jews who had come with her also weeping, He was deeply moved in spirit \f + \fr 11:33 \ft Or He was indignant in spirit; similarly in verse 38\f* and troubled. 
\v 34 \wj “Where have you put him?”\wj* He asked. 
\b
\m “Come and see, Lord,” they answered. 
\b
\m 
\v 35 Jesus wept. 
\b
\m 
\v 36 Then the Jews said, “See how He loved him!” 
\b
\m 
\v 37 But some of them asked, “Could not this man who opened the eyes of the blind also have kept Lazarus from dying?” 
\s1 Jesus Raises Lazarus
\r (Acts 9:36–43)
\b
\m 
\v 38 Jesus, once again deeply moved, came to the tomb. It was a cave with a stone laid across the entrance. 
\v 39 \wj “Take away the stone,”\wj* Jesus said. 
\b
\m “Lord, by now he stinks,” said Martha, the sister of the dead man. “It has already been four days.” 
\b
\m 
\v 40 Jesus replied, \wj “Did I not tell you that if you believed, you would see the glory of God?”\wj* 
\b
\m 
\v 41 So they took away the stone. Then Jesus lifted His eyes upward and said, \wj “Father, I thank You that You have heard Me.\wj* 
\v 42 \wj I knew that You always hear Me, but I say this for the benefit of the people standing here, so they may believe that You sent Me.”\wj* 
\b
\m 
\v 43 After Jesus had said this, He called out in a loud voice, \wj “Lazarus, come out!”\wj* 
\b
\m 
\v 44 The man who had been dead came out with his hands and feet bound in strips of linen, and his face wrapped in a cloth.\f + \fr 11:44 \ft Greek soudariō\f* 
\b
\m \wj “Unwrap him and let him go,”\wj* Jesus told them. 
\s1 The Plot to Kill Jesus
\r (Matthew 26:1–5; Mark 14:1–2; Luke 22:1–2)
\b
\m 
\v 45 Therefore many of the Jews who had come to Mary, and had seen what Jesus did, believed in Him. 
\v 46 But some of them went to the Pharisees and told them what Jesus had done. 
\b
\m 
\v 47 Then the chief priests and Pharisees convened the Sanhedrin \f + \fr 11:47 \ft Or the Council\f* and said, “What are we to do? This man is performing many signs. 
\v 48 If we let Him go on like this, everyone will believe in Him, and then the Romans will come and take away both our place and our nation.” 
\b
\m 
\v 49 But one of them, named Caiaphas, who was high priest that year, said to them, “You know nothing at all! 
\v 50 You do not realize that it is better for you that one man die for the people than that the whole nation perish.” 
\b
\m 
\v 51 Caiaphas did not say this on his own. Instead, as high priest that year, he was prophesying that Jesus would die for the nation, 
\v 52 and not only for the nation, but also for the scattered children of God, to gather them together into one. 
\b
\m 
\v 53 So from that day on they plotted to kill Him. 
\v 54 As a result, Jesus no longer went about publicly among the Jews, but He withdrew to a town called Ephraim in an area near the wilderness. And He stayed there with the disciples. 
\b
\m 
\v 55 Now the Jewish Passover was near, and many people went up from the country to Jerusalem to purify themselves before the Passover. 
\v 56 They kept looking for Jesus and asking one another as they stood in the temple courts,\f + \fr 11:56 \ft Literally the temple\f* “What do you think? Will He come to the feast at all?” 
\v 57 But the chief priests and Pharisees had given orders that anyone who knew where He was must report it, so that they could arrest Him.

\s1 Mary Anoints Jesus
\r (Matthew 26:6–13; Mark 14:3–9; Luke 7:36–50)
\b
\m 
\v 1 Six days before the Passover, Jesus came to Bethany, the hometown of Lazarus, whom He had raised from the dead. 
\v 2 So they hosted a dinner for Jesus there. Martha served, and Lazarus was among those reclining at the table with Him. 
\v 3 Then Mary took about a pint \f + \fr 12:3 \ft Greek a litra; that is, approximately 12 ounces or 340 grams\f* of expensive perfume, made of pure nard, and she anointed Jesus’ feet and wiped them with her hair. And the house was filled with the fragrance of the perfume. 
\b
\m 
\v 4 But one of His disciples, Judas Iscariot, who was going to betray Him, asked, 
\v 5 “Why wasn’t this perfume sold for three hundred denarii \f + \fr 12:5 \ft A denarius was customarily a day’s wage for a laborer; see Matthew 20:2.\f* and the money given to the poor?” 
\v 6 Judas did not say this because he cared about the poor, but because he was a thief. As keeper of the money bag, he used to take from what was put into it. 
\b
\m 
\v 7 \wj “Leave her alone,”\wj* Jesus replied. \wj “She has kept this perfume in preparation for the day of My burial.\wj* 
\v 8 \wj The poor you will always have with you,\wj*\f + \fr 12:8 \ft See Deuteronomy 15:11.\f*\wj but you will not always have Me.”\wj* 
\s1 The Plot to Kill Lazarus
\b
\m 
\v 9 Meanwhile a large crowd of Jews learned that Jesus was there. And they came not only because of Him, but also to see Lazarus, whom He had raised from the dead. 
\v 10 So the chief priests made plans to kill Lazarus as well, 
\v 11 for on account of him many of the Jews were deserting them and believing in Jesus. 
\s1 The Triumphal Entry
\r (Zechariah 9:9–13; Matthew 21:1–11; Mark 11:1–11; Luke 19:28–40)
\b
\m 
\v 12 The next day the great crowd that had come to the feast heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem. 
\v 13 They took palm branches and went out to meet Him, shouting: 
\b
\q1 “Hosanna!”\f + \fr 12:13 \ft Hosanna is a transliteration of the Hebrew Hosia-na, meaning Save, we pray or Save now, which became a shout of praise; see Psalm 118:25.\f* 
\b
\q1 “Blessed is He who comes in the name of the Lord!”\f + \fr 12:13 \ft Psalm 118:26\f*

\q2 See, your King is coming, 
\q2 seated on the colt of a donkey.”\f + \fr 12:15 \ft Zechariah 9:9\f* 
\b

\v 17 Meanwhile, many people continued to testify that they had been with Jesus when He called Lazarus from the tomb and raised him from the dead. 
\v 18 That is also why the crowd went out to meet Him, because they heard that He had performed this sign. 
\b
\m 
\v 19 Then the Pharisees said to one another, “You can see that this is doing you no good. Look how the whole world has gone after Him!” 
\s1 Jesus Predicts His Death
\b
\m 
\v 20 Now there were some Greeks among those who went up to worship at the feast. 
\v 21 They came to Philip, who was from Bethsaida in Galilee, and requested of him, “Sir, we want to see Jesus.” 
\v 22 Philip relayed this appeal to Andrew, and both of them went and told Jesus. 
\b
\m 
\v 23 But Jesus replied, \wj “The hour has come for the Son of Man to be glorified.\wj* 
\v 24 \wj Truly, truly, I tell you, unless a kernel of wheat falls to the ground and dies, it remains only a seed; but if it dies, it bears much fruit.\wj* 
\v 25 \wj Whoever loves his life will lose it, but whoever hates his life in this world will keep it for eternal life.\wj* 
\v 26 \wj If anyone serves Me, he must follow Me; and where I am, My servant will be as well. If anyone serves Me, the Father will honor him.\wj* 
\b
\m 
\v 27 \wj Now My soul is troubled, and what shall I say? ‘Father, save Me from this hour’? No, it is for this purpose that I have come to this hour.\wj* 
\v 28 \wj Father, glorify Your name!”\wj* 
\b
\m Then a voice came from heaven: “I have glorified it, and I will glorify it again.” 
\b
\m 
\v 29 The crowd standing there heard it and said that it had thundered. Others said that an angel had spoken to Him. 
\b
\m 
\v 30 In response, Jesus said, \wj “This voice was not for My benefit, but yours.\wj* 
\v 31 \wj Now judgment is upon this world; now the prince of this world will be cast out.\wj* 
\v 32 \wj And I, when I am lifted up from the earth, will draw everyone to Myself.”\wj* 
\v 33 He said this to indicate the kind of death He was going to die. 
\b
\m 
\v 34 The crowd replied, “We have heard from the Law that the Christ will remain forever. So how can you say that the Son of Man must be lifted up? Who is this Son of Man?” 
\b
\m 
\v 35 Then Jesus told them, \wj “For a little while longer, the Light will be among you. Walk while you have the Light, so that darkness will not overtake you. The one who walks in the darkness does not know where he is going.\wj* 
\v 36 \wj While you have the Light, believe in the Light, so that you may become sons of light.”\wj* 
\b
\m After Jesus had spoken these things, He went away and was hidden from them. 
\s1 Belief and Unbelief
\b
\m 
\v 37 Although Jesus had performed so many signs in their presence, they still did not believe in Him. 
\v 38 This was to fulfill the word of Isaiah the prophet: 
\b
\q1 “Lord, who has believed our message? 
\q2 And to whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed?”\f + \fr 12:38 \ft Isaiah 53:1\f* 
\b
\m 
\v 39 For this reason they were unable to believe. For again, Isaiah says: 
\b
\q1 
\v 40 “He has blinded their eyes 
\q2 and hardened their hearts, 
\q1 so that they cannot see with their eyes, 
\q2 and understand with their hearts, 
\q1 and turn, 
\q2 and I would heal them.”\f + \fr 12:40 \ft Isaiah 6:10\f* 
\b
\m 
\v 41 Isaiah said these things because he saw Jesus’ glory and spoke about Him. 
\v 42 Nevertheless, many of the leaders believed in Him; but because of the Pharisees they did not confess Him, for fear that they would be put out of the synagogue. 
\v 43 For they loved praise from men more than praise from God. 
\b
\m 
\v 44 Then Jesus cried out, \wj “Whoever believes in Me does not believe in Me alone, but in the One who sent Me.\wj* 
\v 45 \wj And whoever sees Me sees the One who sent Me.\wj* 
\v 46 \wj I have come into the world as a light, so that no one who believes in Me should remain in darkness.\wj* 
\b
\m 
\v 47 \wj As for anyone who hears My words and does not keep them, I do not judge him. For I have not come to judge the world, but to save the world.\wj* 
\v 48 \wj There is a judge for the one who rejects Me and does not receive My words: The word that I have spoken will judge him on the last day.\wj* 
\b
\m 
\v 49 \wj I have not spoken on My own, but the Father who sent Me has commanded Me what to say and how to say it.\wj* 
\v 50 \wj And I know that His command leads to eternal life. So I speak exactly what the Father has told Me to say.”\wj* 
\c 13
\s1 Jesus Washes His Disciples’ Feet
\b
\m 
\v 1 It was now just before the Passover Feast, and Jesus knew that His hour had come to leave this world and return to the Father. Having loved His own who were in the world, He loved them to the very end.\f + \fr 13:1 \ft Or He showed them the full extent of His love.\f* 
\v 2 The evening meal was underway, and the devil had already put into the heart of Judas, the son of Simon Iscariot, to betray Jesus. 
\b
\m 
\v 3 Jesus knew that the Father had delivered all things into His hands, and that He had come from God and was returning to God. 
\v 4 So He got up from the supper, laid aside His outer garments, and wrapped a towel around His waist. 
\v 5 After that, He poured water into a basin and began to wash the disciples’ feet and dry them with the towel that was around Him. 
\b
\m 
\v 6 He came to Simon Peter, who asked Him, “Lord, are You going to wash my feet?” 
\b
\m 
\v 7 Jesus replied, \wj “You do not realize now what I am doing, but later you will understand.”\wj* 
\b
\m 
\v 8 “Never shall You wash my feet!” Peter told Him. 
\b
\m Jesus answered, \wj “Unless I wash you, you have no part with Me.”\wj* 
\b
\m 
\v 9 “Then, Lord,” Simon Peter replied, “not only my feet, but my hands and my head as well!” 
\b
\m 
\v 10 Jesus told him, \wj “Whoever has already bathed needs only to wash his feet, and he will be completely clean. And you are clean, though not all of you.”\wj* 
\v 11 For He knew who would betray Him. That is why He said, \wj “Not all of you are clean.”\wj* 
\b
\m 
\v 12 When Jesus had washed their feet and put on His outer garments, He reclined with them again and asked, \wj “Do you know what I have done for you?\wj* 
\v 13 \wj You call Me Teacher and Lord, and rightly so, because I am.\wj* 
\v 14 \wj So if I, your Lord and Teacher, have washed your feet, you also should wash one another’s feet.\wj* 
\v 15 \wj I have set you an example so that you should do as I have done for you.\wj* 
\v 16 \wj Truly, truly, I tell you, no servant is greater than his master,\wj*\f + \fr 13:16 \ft Cited in John 15:20\f*\wj nor is a messenger greater than the one who sent him.\wj* 
\v 17 \wj If you know these things, you will be blessed if you do them.\wj* 
\s1 Jesus Predicts His Betrayal
\r (Psalm 41:1–13)
\b
\m 
\v 18 \wj I am not speaking about all of you; I know whom I have chosen. But this is to fulfill the Scripture: ‘The one who shares My bread has lifted up his heel against Me.’\wj*\f + \fr 13:18 \ft Psalm 41:9\f* 
\v 19 \wj I am telling you now before it happens, so that when it comes to pass, you will believe that I am He.\wj* 
\v 20 \wj Truly, truly, I tell you, whoever receives the one I send receives Me, and whoever receives Me receives the One who sent Me.”\wj* 
\b
\m 
\v 21 After Jesus had said this, He became troubled in spirit and testified, \wj “Truly, truly, I tell you, one of you will betray Me.”\wj* 
\b
\m 
\v 22 The disciples looked at one another, perplexed as to which of them He meant. 
\v 23 One of His disciples, the one whom Jesus loved, was reclining at His side.\f + \fr 13:23 \ft Greek was reclining in the bosom of Jesus\f* 
\v 24 So Simon Peter motioned to him to ask Jesus which one He was talking about. 
\v 25 Leaning back against Jesus, he asked, “Lord, who is it?” 
\b
\m 
\v 26 Jesus answered, \wj “It is the one to whom I give this morsel after I have dipped it.”\wj* Then He dipped the morsel and gave it to Judas son of Simon Iscariot. 
\v 27 And when Judas had taken the morsel, Satan entered into him. 
\b
\m Then Jesus said to Judas, \wj “What you are about to do, do quickly.”\wj* 
\v 28 But no one at the table knew why Jesus had said this to him. 
\v 29 Since Judas kept the money bag, some thought that Jesus was telling him to buy what was needed for the feast, or to give something to the poor. 
\v 30 As soon as he had received the morsel, Judas went out into the night. 
\s1 Love One Another
\r (Romans 12:9–13; 1 John 3:11–24)
\b
\m 
\v 31 When Judas had gone out, Jesus said, \wj “Now the Son of Man is glorified, and God is glorified in Him.\wj* 
\v 32 \wj If God is glorified in Him,\wj*\f + \fr 13:32 \ft WH does not include If God is glorified in Him.\f*\wj God will also glorify the Son in Himself—and will glorify Him at once.\wj*

\m 
\v 33 \wj Little children, I am with you only a little while longer. You will look for Me, and as I said to the Jews, so now I say to you: ‘Where I am going, you cannot come.’\wj* 
\b
\m

\v 35 \wj By this everyone will know that you are My disciples, if you love one another.”\wj* 
\s1 Jesus Predicts Peter’s Denial
\r (Matthew 26:31–35; Mark 14:27–31; Luke 22:31–38)
\b
\m 
\v 36 “Lord, where are You going?” Simon Peter asked. 
\b
\m Jesus answered, \wj “Where I am going, you cannot follow Me now, but you will follow later.”\wj* 
\b
\m 
\v 37 “Lord,” said Peter, “why can’t I follow You now? I will lay down my life for You.” 
\b
\m 
\v 38 \wj “Will you lay down your life for Me?”\wj* Jesus replied. \wj “Truly, truly, I tell you, before the rooster crows, you will deny Me three times.\wj*

\s1 The Betrayal of Jesus
\r (Matthew 26:47–56; Mark 14:43–52; Luke 22:47–53)
\b
\m 
\v 1 After Jesus had spoken these words, He went out with His disciples across the Kidron Valley, where they entered a garden. 
\v 2 Now Judas His betrayer also knew the place, because Jesus had often met there with His disciples. 
\v 3 So Judas brought a band of soldiers and officers from the chief priests and Pharisees. They arrived at the garden carrying lanterns, torches, and weapons. 
\b
\m 
\v 4 Jesus, knowing all that was coming upon Him, stepped forward and asked them, \wj “Whom are you seeking?”\wj* 
\b
\m 
\v 5 “Jesus of Nazareth,” they answered. 
\b
\m Jesus said, \wj “I am He.”\wj* 
\b
\m And Judas His betrayer was standing there with them. 
\v 6 When Jesus said, \wj “I am He,”\wj* they drew back and fell to the ground. 
\b
\m 
\v 7 So He asked them again, \wj “Whom are you seeking?”\wj* 
\b
\m “Jesus of Nazareth,” they answered. 
\b
\m 
\v 8 \wj “I told you that I am He,”\wj* Jesus replied. \wj “So if you are looking for Me, let these men go.”\wj* 
\v 9 This was to fulfill the word He had spoken: \wj “I have not lost one of those You have given Me.”\wj*\f + \fr 18:9 \ft See John 6:39 and John 17:12.\f* 
\b
\m 
\v 10 Then Simon Peter drew his sword and struck the servant of the high priest, cutting off his right ear. The servant’s name was Malchus. 
\b
\m 
\v 11 \wj “Put your sword back in its sheath!”\wj* Jesus said to Peter. \wj “Shall I not drink the cup the Father has given Me?”\wj* 
\b
\m 
\v 12 Then the band of soldiers, with its commander and the officers of the Jews, arrested Jesus and bound Him. 
\v 13 They brought Him first to Annas, who was the father-in-law of Caiaphas, the high priest that year. 
\v 14 Caiaphas was the one who had advised the Jews that it would be better if one man died for the people. 
\s1 Peter’s First Denial
\r (Matthew 26:69–70; Mark 14:66–68; Luke 22:54–57)
\b
\m 
\v 15 Now Simon Peter and another disciple were following Jesus. Since that disciple was known to the high priest, he also went with Jesus into the courtyard of the high priest. 
\v 16 But Peter stood outside at the door. Then the disciple who was known to the high priest went out and spoke to the doorkeeper, and brought Peter in. 
\b
\m 
\v 17 At this, the servant girl watching the door said to Peter, “Aren’t you also one of this man’s disciples?” 
\b
\m “I am not,” he answered. 
\b
\m 
\v 18 Because it was cold, the servants and officers were standing around a charcoal fire they had made to keep warm. And Peter was also standing with them, warming himself. 
\s1 Jesus before the High Priest
\r (Matthew 26:57–68; Mark 14:53–65; Luke 22:66–71)
\b
\m 
\v 19 Meanwhile, the high priest questioned Jesus about His disciples and His teaching. 
\b
\m 
\v 20 \wj “I have spoken openly to the world,”\wj* Jesus answered. \wj “I always taught in the synagogues and at the temple, where all the Jews come together. I said nothing in secret.\wj* 
\v 21 \wj Why are you asking Me? Ask those who heard My message. Surely they know what I said.”\wj* 
\b
\m 
\v 22 When Jesus had said this, one of the officers standing nearby slapped Him in the face and said, “Is this how You answer the high priest?” 
\b
\m 
\v 23 Jesus replied, \wj “If I said something wrong, testify as to what was wrong. But if I spoke correctly, why did you strike Me?”\wj* 
\b
\m 
\v 24 Then Annas sent Him, still bound, to Caiaphas the high priest. 
\s1 Peter’s Second and Third Denials
\r (Matthew 26:71–75; Mark 14:69–72; Luke 22:58–62)
\b
\m 
\v 25 Simon Peter was still standing and warming himself. So they asked him, “Aren’t you also one of His disciples?” 
\b
\m He denied it and said, “I am not.” 
\b
\m 
\v 26 One of the high priest’s servants, a relative of the man whose ear Peter had cut off, asked, “Didn’t I see you with Him in the garden?” 
\b
\m 
\v 27 Peter denied it once more, and immediately a rooster crowed. 
\s1 Jesus before Pilate
\r (Matthew 27:11–14; Luke 23:1–5)
\b
\m 
\v 28 Then they led Jesus away from Caiaphas into the Praetorium. By now it was early morning, and the Jews did not enter the Praetorium, to avoid being defiled and unable to eat the Passover. 
\b
\m 
\v 29 So Pilate went out to them and asked, “What accusation are you bringing against this man?” 
\b
\m 
\v 30 “If He were not a criminal,” they replied, “we would not have handed Him over to you.” 
\b
\m 
\v 31 “You take Him and judge Him by your own law,” Pilate told them. 
\b
\m “We are not permitted to execute anyone,” the Jews replied. 
\v 32 This was to fulfill the word that Jesus had spoken to indicate the kind of death He was going to die.\f + \fr 18:32 \ft See John 12:32–33.\f* 
\b
\m 
\v 33 Pilate went back into the Praetorium, summoned Jesus, and asked Him, “Are You the King of the Jews?” 
\b
\m 
\v 34 \wj “Are you saying this on your own,”\wj* Jesus asked, \wj “or did others tell you about Me?”\wj* 
\b
\m 
\v 35 “Am I a Jew?” Pilate replied. “Your own people and chief priests handed You over to me. What have You done?” 
\b
\m 
\v 36 Jesus answered, \wj “My kingdom is not of this world; if it were, My servants would fight to prevent My arrest by the Jews. But now My kingdom is not of this realm.”\wj* 
\b
\m 
\v 37 “Then You are a king!” Pilate said. 
\b
\m \wj “You say that I am a king,”\wj* Jesus answered. \wj “For this reason I was born and have come into the world, to testify to the truth. Everyone who belongs to the truth listens to My voice.”\wj* 
\b
\m 
\v 38 “What is truth?” Pilate asked. 
\b
\m And having said this, he went out again to the Jews and told them, “I find no basis for a charge against Him. 
\v 39 But it is your custom that I release to you one prisoner at the Passover. So then, do you want me to release to you the King of the Jews?” 
\b
\m 
\v 40 “Not this man,” they shouted, “but Barabbas!” (Now Barabbas was an insurrectionist.) 
\c 19
\s1 The Soldiers Mock Jesus
\r (Isaiah 50:4–11; Matthew 27:27–31; Mark 15:16–20; Luke 22:63–65)
\b
\m 
\v 1 Then Pilate took Jesus and had Him flogged. 
\v 2 The soldiers twisted together a crown of thorns, set it on His head, and dressed Him in a purple robe. 
\v 3 And they went up to Him again and again, saying, “Hail, King of the Jews!” and slapping Him in the face. 
\b
\m 
\v 4 Once again Pilate came out and said to the Jews, “Look, I am bringing Him out to you to let you know that I find no basis for a charge against Him.” 
\v 5 When Jesus came out wearing the crown of thorns and the purple robe, Pilate said to them, “Here is the man!” 
\b
\m 
\v 6 As soon as the chief priests and officers saw Him, they shouted, “Crucify Him! Crucify Him!” 
\b
\m “You take Him and crucify Him,” Pilate replied, “for I find no basis for a charge against Him.” 
\b
\m 
\v 7 “We have a law,” answered the Jews, “and according to that law He must die, because He declared Himself to be the Son of God.” 
\b
\m 
\v 8 When Pilate heard this statement, he was even more afraid, 
\v 9 and he went back into the Praetorium. “Where are You from?” he asked. 
\b
\m But Jesus gave no answer. 
\b
\m 
\v 10 So Pilate said to Him, “Do You refuse to speak to me? Do You not know that I have authority to release You and authority to crucify You?” 
\b
\m 
\v 11 Jesus answered, \wj “You would have no authority over Me if it were not given to you from above. Therefore the one who handed Me over to you is guilty of greater sin.”\wj* 
\b
\m 
\v 12 From then on, Pilate tried to release Him, but the Jews kept shouting, “If you release this man, you are no friend of Caesar. Anyone who declares himself a king is defying Caesar.” 
\b
\m 
\v 13 When Pilate heard these words, he brought Jesus out and sat on the judgment seat at a place called the Stone Pavement, which in Hebrew \f + \fr 19:13 \ft Or in Aramaic; also in verses 17 and 20\f* is Gabbatha. 
\v 14 It was the day of Preparation for the Passover, about the sixth hour.\f + \fr 19:14 \ft That is, about noon\f* And Pilate said to the Jews, “Here is your King!” 
\b
\m 
\v 15 At this, they shouted, “Away with Him! Away with Him! Crucify Him!” 
\b
\m “Shall I crucify your King?” Pilate asked. 
\b
\m “We have no king but Caesar,” replied the chief priests. 
\s1 The Crucifixion
\r (Psalm 22:1–31; Matthew 27:32–44; Mark 15:21–32; Luke 23:26–43)
\b
\m 
\v 16 Then Pilate handed Jesus over to be crucified, and the soldiers took Him away. 
\v 17 Carrying His own cross, He went out to The Place of the Skull, which in Hebrew is called Golgotha. 
\b
\m 
\v 18 There they crucified Him, and with Him two others, one on each side, with Jesus in the middle. 
\b
\m 
\v 19 Pilate also had a notice posted on the cross. It read: 
\b
\pc JESUS OF NAZARETH, 
\pc THE KING OF THE JEWS. 
\b
\m 
\v 20 Many of the Jews read this sign, because the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city, and it was written in Hebrew, Latin, and Greek. 
\v 21 So the chief priests of the Jews said to Pilate, “Do not write, ‘The King of the Jews,’ but only that He said, ‘I am the King of the Jews.’” 
\b
\m 
\v 22 Pilate answered, “What I have written, I have written.” 
\b
\m 
\v 23 When the soldiers had crucified Jesus, they divided His garments into four parts, one for each soldier, with the tunic remaining. It was seamless, woven in one piece from top to bottom. 
\v 24 So they said to one another, “Let us not tear it. Instead, let us cast lots to see who will get it.” This was to fulfill the Scripture: 
\b
\q1 “They divided My garments among them, 
\q2 and cast lots for My clothing.”\f + \fr 19:24 \ft Psalm 22:18\f* 
\b
\m So that is what the soldiers did. 
\b
\m 
\v 25 Near the cross of Jesus stood His mother and her sister, as well as Mary the wife of Clopas and Mary Magdalene. 
\v 26 When Jesus saw His mother and the disciple whom He loved standing nearby, He said to His mother, \wj “Woman, here is your son.”\wj* 
\v 27 Then He said to the disciple, \wj “Here is your mother.”\wj* So from that hour, this disciple took her into his home. 
\s1 The Death of Jesus
\r (Psalm 22:1–31; Matthew 27:45–56; Mark 15:33–41; Luke 23:44–49)
\b
\m 
\v 28 After this, knowing that everything had now been accomplished, and to fulfill the Scripture, Jesus said, \wj “I am thirsty.”\wj*\f + \fr 19:28 \ft See Psalm 22:15.\f* 
\v 29 A jar of sour wine \f + \fr 19:29 \ft Or A jar of wine vinegar; similarly in verse 30\f* was sitting there. So they soaked a sponge in the wine, put it on a stalk of hyssop, and lifted it to His mouth.\f + \fr 19:29 \ft See Psalm 69:21.\f* 
\v 30 When Jesus had received the sour wine, He said, \wj “It is finished.”\wj* And bowing His head, He yielded up His spirit. 
\s1 Jesus’ Side Is Pierced
\r (Zechariah 12:10–14)
\b
\m 
\v 31 It was the day of Preparation, and the next day was a High Sabbath. In order that the bodies would not remain on the cross during the Sabbath, the Jews asked Pilate to have the legs broken and the bodies removed. 
\v 32 So the soldiers came and broke the legs of the first man who had been crucified with Jesus, and those of the other. 
\b
\m 
\v 33 But when they came to Jesus and saw that He was already dead, they did not break His legs. 
\v 34 Instead, one of the soldiers pierced His side with a spear, and immediately blood and water flowed out. 
\v 35 The one who saw it has testified to this, and his testimony is true. He knows that he is telling the truth, so that you also may believe. 
\b
\m 
\v 36 Now these things happened so that the Scripture would be fulfilled: “Not one of His bones will be broken.”\f + \fr 19:36 \ft Psalm 34:20; see also Exodus 12:46 and Numbers 9:12.\f* 
\v 37 And, as another Scripture says: “They will look on the One they have pierced.”\f + \fr 19:37 \ft Zechariah 12:10\f* 
\s1 The Burial of Jesus
\r (Isaiah 53:9–12; Matthew 27:57–61; Mark 15:42–47; Luke 23:50–56)
\b
\m 
\v 38 Afterward, Joseph of Arimathea, who was a disciple of Jesus (but secretly for fear of the Jews), asked Pilate to let him remove the body of Jesus. Pilate gave him permission, so he came and removed His body. 
\v 39 Nicodemus, who had previously come to Jesus at night, also brought a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about seventy-five pounds.\f + \fr 19:39 \ft Greek about a hundred litras; that is, approximately 34 kilograms\f* 
\v 40 So they took the body of Jesus and wrapped it in linen cloths with the spices, according to the Jewish burial custom. 
\b
\m 
\v 41 Now there was a garden in the place where Jesus was crucified, and in the garden a new tomb in which no one had yet been laid. 
\v 42 And because it was the Jewish day of Preparation and the tomb was nearby, they placed Jesus there. 
\c 20
\s1 The Resurrection
\r (Matthew 28:1–10; Mark 16:1–8; Luke 24:1–12)
\b
\m 
\v 1 Early on the first day of the week,\f + \fr 20:1 \ft Literally Now on the first of the Sabbaths, early,\f* while it was still dark, Mary Magdalene went to the tomb and saw that the stone had been removed from the entrance. 
\v 2 So she came running to Simon Peter and the other disciple, the one whom Jesus loved. “They have taken the Lord out of the tomb,” she said, “and we do not know where they have put Him!” 
\b
\m 
\v 3 Then Peter and the other disciple set out for the tomb. 
\v 4 The two were running together, but the other disciple outran Peter and reached the tomb first. 
\v 5 He bent down and looked in at the linen cloths lying there, but he did not go in. 
\b
\m 
\v 6 Simon Peter arrived just after him. He entered the tomb and saw the linen cloths lying there. 
\v 7 The cloth \f + \fr 20:7 \ft Greek soudarion\f* that had been around Jesus’ head was rolled up, lying separate from the linen cloths. 
\v 8 Then the other disciple, who had reached the tomb first, also went in. And he saw and believed. 
\v 9 For they still did not understand from the Scripture that Jesus had to rise from the dead. 
\s1 Jesus Appears to Mary Magdalene
\r (Mark 16:9–11)
\b
\m 
\v 10 Then the disciples returned to their homes. 
\v 11 But Mary stood outside the tomb weeping. And as she wept, she bent down to look into the tomb, 
\v 12 and she saw two angels in white sitting where the body of Jesus had lain, one at the head and the other at the feet. 
\b
\m 
\v 13 “Woman, why are you weeping?” they asked. 
\b
\m “Because they have taken my Lord away,” she said, “and I do not know where they have put Him.” 
\b
\m 
\v 14 When she had said this, she turned around and saw Jesus standing there; but she did not recognize that it was Jesus. 
\b
\m 
\v 15 \wj “Woman, why are you weeping?”\wj* Jesus asked. \wj “Whom are you seeking?”\wj* 
\b
\m Thinking He was the gardener, she said, “Sir, if you have carried Him off, tell me where you have put Him, and I will get Him.” 
\b
\m 
\v 16 Jesus said to her, \wj “Mary.”\wj* 
\b
\m She turned and said to Him in Hebrew,\f + \fr 20:16 \ft Or in Aramaic\f* “Rabboni!” (which means “Teacher”). 
\b
\m 
\v 17 \wj “Do not cling to Me,”\wj* Jesus said, \wj “for I have not yet ascended to the Father. But go and tell My brothers, ‘I am ascending to My Father and your Father, to My God and your God.’”\wj* 
\b
\m 
\v 18 Mary Magdalene went and announced to the disciples, “I have seen the Lord!” And she told them what He had said to her. 
\s1 Jesus Appears to the Disciples
\r (Luke 24:36–49; 1 John 1:1–4)
\b
\m 
\v 19 It was the first day of the week, and that very evening, while the disciples were together with the doors locked for fear of the Jews, Jesus came and stood among them. \wj “Peace be with you!”\wj* He said to them. 
\v 20 After He had said this, He showed them His hands and His side. 
\b
\m The disciples rejoiced when they saw the Lord. 
\b
\m 
\v 21 Again Jesus said to them, \wj “Peace be with you. As the Father has sent Me, so also I am sending you.”\wj* 
\v 22 When He had said this, He breathed on them and said, \wj “Receive the Holy Spirit.\wj* 
\v 23 \wj If you forgive anyone his sins, they are forgiven; if you withhold forgiveness from anyone, it is withheld.”\wj* 
\s1 Jesus Appears to Thomas
\b
\m 
\v 24 Now Thomas called Didymus,\f + \fr 20:24 \ft Didymus means the twin.\f* one of the Twelve, was not with the disciples when Jesus came. 
\v 25 So the other disciples told him, “We have seen the Lord!” 
\b
\m But he replied, “Unless I see the nail marks in His hands, and put my finger where the nails have been, and put my hand into His side, I will never believe.” 
\b
\m 
\v 26 Eight days later, His disciples were once again inside with the doors locked, and Thomas was with them. Jesus came and stood among them and said, \wj “Peace be with you.”\wj* 
\b
\m 
\v 27 Then Jesus said to Thomas, \wj “Put your finger here and look at My hands. Reach out your hand and put it into My side. Stop doubting and believe.”\wj* 
\b
\m 
\v 28 Thomas replied, “My Lord and my God!” 
\b
\m 
\v 29 Jesus said to him, \wj “Because you have seen Me, you have believed; blessed are those who have not seen and yet have believed.”\wj* 
\s1 The Purpose of John’s Book
\b
\m 
\v 30 Jesus performed many other signs in the presence of His disciples, which are not written in this book. 
\v 31 But these are written so that you may believe \f + \fr 20:31 \ft Or may continue to believe\f* that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that by believing you may have life in His name. 
\c 21
\s1 Jesus Appears by the Sea of Tiberias
\b
\m
\v 1 Later, by the Sea of Tiberias,\f + \fr 21:1 \ft That is, the Sea of Galilee\f* Jesus again revealed Himself to the disciples. He made Himself known in this way:
\v 2 Simon Peter, Thomas called Didymus,\f + \fr 21:2 \ft Didymus means the twin.\f* Nathanael from Cana in Galilee, the sons of Zebedee, and two other disciples were together.
\v 3 Simon Peter told them, “I am going fishing.”
\b
\m “We will go with you,” they said. So they went out and got into the boat, but caught nothing that night.
\b
\m
\v 4 Early in the morning, Jesus stood on the shore, but the disciples did not recognize that it was Jesus.
\v 5 So He called out to them, \wj “Children, do you have any fish?”\wj*
\b
\m “No,” they answered.
\b
\m
\v 6 He told them, \wj “Cast the net on the right side of the boat, and you will find some.”\wj* So they cast it there, and they were unable to haul it in because of the great number of fish.
\b
\m
\v 7 Then the disciple whom Jesus loved said to Peter, “It is the Lord!” As soon as Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord, he put on his outer garment (for he had removed it) and jumped into the sea.
\v 8 The other disciples came ashore in the boat. They dragged in the net full of fish, for they were not far from land, only about a hundred yards.\f + \fr 21:8 \ft Greek about two hundred cubits away; that is, approximately 300 feet or 91 meters\f*
\b
\m
\v 9 When they landed, they saw a charcoal fire there with fish on it, and some bread.
\b
\m
\v 10 Jesus told them, \wj “Bring some of the fish you have just caught.”\wj*
\v 11 So Simon Peter went aboard and dragged the net ashore. It was full of large fish, 153, but even with so many, the net was not torn.
\b
\m
\v 12 \wj “Come, have breakfast,”\wj* Jesus said to them. None of the disciples dared to ask Him, “Who are You?” They knew it was the Lord.
\v 13 Jesus came and took the bread and gave it to them, and He did the same with the fish.
\b
\m
\v 14 This was now the third time that Jesus appeared to the disciples after He was raised from the dead.
\s1 Jesus and Peter
\b
\m
\v 15 When they had finished eating, Jesus asked Simon Peter, \wj “Simon son of John, do you love Me more than these?”\wj*
\b
\m “Yes, Lord,” he answered, “You know I love You.”
\b
\m Jesus replied, \wj “Feed My lambs.”\wj*
\b
\m
\v 16 Jesus asked a second time, \wj “Simon son of John, do you love Me?”\wj*
\b
\m “Yes, Lord,” he answered, “You know I love You.”
\b
\m Jesus told him, \wj “Shepherd My sheep.”\wj*
\b
\m
\v 17 Jesus asked a third time, \wj “Simon son of John, do you love Me?” \wj*
\b
\m Peter was deeply hurt that Jesus had asked him a third time, \wj “Do you love Me?” \wj*
\b
\m “Lord, You know all things,” he replied. “You know I love You.”
\b
\m Jesus said to him, \wj “Feed My sheep.\wj*
\b
\m
\v 18 \wj Truly, truly, I tell you, when you were young, you dressed yourself and walked where you wanted; but when you are old, you will stretch out your hands, and someone else\wj* \f + \fr 21:18 \ft Or others\f*\wj will dress you and lead you where you do not want to go.”\wj*
\v 19 Jesus said this to indicate the kind of death by which Peter would glorify God.
\b
\m And after He had said this, He told him, \wj “Follow Me.”\wj*
\s1 Jesus and the Beloved Disciple
\b
\m
\v 20 Peter turned and saw the disciple whom Jesus loved following them. He was the one who had leaned back against Jesus \f + \fr 21:20 \ft Greek reclined on His bosom\f* at the supper to ask, “Lord, who is going to betray You?”
\v 21 When Peter saw him, he asked, “Lord, what about him?”
