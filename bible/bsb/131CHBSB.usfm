\s1 The Descendants of Reuben
\b
\m 
\v 1 These were the sons of Reuben the firstborn of Israel. Though he was the firstborn, his birthright was given to the sons of Joseph son of Israel, because Reuben defiled his father’s bed. So he is not reckoned according to birthright.

\v 7 His relatives by their clans are recorded in their genealogy: 
\b
\li2 Jeiel the chief, Zechariah, 
\v 8 and Bela son of Azaz, the son of Shema, the son of Joel. They settled in Aroer and as far as Nebo and Baal-meon. 
\v 9 They also settled in the east as far as the edge of the desert that extends to the Euphrates River, because their livestock had increased in the land of Gilead. 
\b
\li2 
\v 10 During the days of Saul they waged war against the Hagrites, who were defeated at their hands, and they occupied the homes of the Hagrites throughout the region east of Gilead.

\b
\li1 
\v 13 Their kinsmen by families were Michael, Meshullam, Sheba, Jorai, Jacan, Zia, and Eber—seven in all.

\v 15 Ahi son of Abdiel, the son of Guni, was head of their family. 
\b
\li1 
\v 16 They lived in Gilead, in Bashan and its towns, and throughout the pasturelands of Sharon. 
\v 17 All of them were reckoned in the genealogies during the reigns of Jotham king of Judah and Jeroboam king of Israel. 
\b
\li1 
\v 18 The Reubenites, the Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh had 44,760 warriors—valiant men who carried the shield and sword, drew the bow, and were trained for battle. 
\v 19 They waged war against the Hagrites, as well as Jetur, Naphish, and Nodab. 
\b
\li1 
\v 20 And because they cried out to God in battle, they were helped against their enemies, and the Hagrites and all their allies were delivered into their hands. Because they put their trust in God, He answered their prayers. 
\v 21 They seized the livestock of the Hagrites—50,000 camels, 250,000 sheep, and 2,000 donkeys. They also took 100,000 captives, 
\v 22 and many others fell slain, because the battle belonged to God. And they occupied the land until the exile. 
\s1 The Half-Tribe of Manasseh
\b
\m 
\v 23 Now the people of the half-tribe of Manasseh were numerous. They settled in the land from Bashan to Baal-hermon (that is, Senir, also known as Mount Hermon).\f + \fr 5:23 \ft Literally from Bashan to Baal-hermon and Senir and Mount Hermon.\f* 
\v 24 These were the heads of their families: 
\b
\li1 Epher, Ishi, Eliel, Azriel, Jeremiah, Hodaviah, and Jahdiel. 
\b
\li1 They were mighty men of valor, famous men, and heads of their families. 
\v 25 But they were unfaithful to the God of their fathers, and they prostituted themselves with the gods of the peoples of the land, whom God had destroyed before them. 
\b
\li1 
\v 26 So the God of Israel stirred up the spirit of Pul king of Assyria (that is, Tiglath-pileser king of Assyria) to take the Reubenites, the Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh into exile. And he brought them to Halah, Habor, Hara, and the river of Gozan, where they remain to this day.

\m 
\v 4 Then Saul said to his armor-bearer, “Draw your sword and run it through me, or these uncircumcised men will come and torture me!”

\m But his armor-bearer was terrified and refused to do it. So Saul took his own sword and fell on it.

\v 8 The next day, when the Philistines came to strip the dead, they found Saul and his sons fallen on Mount Gilboa.

\v 16 At that time David was in the stronghold, and the garrison of the Philistines was at Bethlehem. 
\v 17 David longed for water and said, “Oh, that someone would get me a drink of water from the well near the gate of Bethlehem!” 
\b
\m 
\v 18 So the Three broke through the Philistine camp, drew water from the well at the gate of Bethlehem, and brought it back to David. But he refused to drink it; instead, he poured it out to the LORD, 
\v 19 saying, “Far be it from me, my God, to do this! How can I drink the blood of these men who risked their lives?” Because they had brought it at the risk of their lives, David refused to drink it.

\s1 The Mighty Men Join David at Ziklag
\b
\m 
\v 1 Now these were the men who came to David at Ziklag, while he was still banished from the presence of Saul son of Kish (they were among the mighty men who helped him in battle; 
\v 2 they were archers using both the right and left hands to sling stones and shoot arrows; and they were Saul’s kinsmen from Benjamin): 
\b
\li1 
\v 3 Ahiezer their chief and Joash, who were the sons of Shemaah the Gibeathite; 
\b
\li1 Jeziel and Pelet, the sons of Azmaveth; 
\b
\li1 Beracah; 
\b
\li1 Jehu the Anathothite; 
\b
\li1 
\v 4 Ishmaiah the Gibeonite, a mighty man among the Thirty and a leader over the Thirty; 
\b
\li1 Jeremiah, Jahaziel, Johanan, and Jozabad the Gederathite; 
\b
\li1 
\v 5 Eluzai, Jerimoth, Bealiah, Shemariah, and Shephatiah the Haruphite; 
\b
\li1 
\v 6 Elkanah, Isshiah, Azarel, Joezer, and Jashobeam, who were Korahites; 
\b
\li1 
\v 7 and Joelah and Zebadiah, the sons of Jeroham from Gedor. 
\b
\m 
\v 8 Some Gadites defected to David at his stronghold in the desert. They were mighty men of valor, trained for battle, experts with the shield and spear, whose faces were like the faces of lions and who were as swift as gazelles on the mountains: 
\b
\li1 
\v 9 Ezer the chief, Obadiah the second in command, Eliab the third, 
\v 10 Mishmannah the fourth, Jeremiah the fifth, 
\v 11 Attai the sixth, Eliel the seventh, 
\v 12 Johanan the eighth, Elzabad the ninth, 
\v 13 Jeremiah the tenth, and Machbanai the eleventh. 
\b
\m 
\v 14 These Gadites were army commanders, the least of whom was a match for a hundred, and the greatest for a thousand. 
\b
\m 
\v 15 These are the ones who crossed the Jordan in the first month when it was overflowing all its banks, and they put to flight all those in the valleys, both to the east and to the west. 
\b
\m 
\v 16 Other Benjamites and some men from Judah also came to David in his stronghold. 
\v 17 And David went out to meet them, saying, “If you have come to me in peace to help me, my heart will be united with you; but if you have come to betray me to my enemies when my hands are free of violence, may the God of our fathers see it and judge you.” 
\b
\m 
\v 18 Then the Spirit came upon Amasai, the chief of the Thirty, and he said: 
\b
\q1 “We are yours, O David! 
\q2 We are with you, O son of Jesse! 
\q1 Peace, peace to you, 
\q2 and peace to your helpers, 
\q2 for your God helps you.” 
\b
\m So David received them and made them leaders of his troops. 
\b
\m 
\v 19 Some from Manasseh defected to David when he went with the Philistines to fight against Saul. (They did not help the Philistines because the Philistine rulers consulted and sent David away, saying, “It will cost us our heads if he defects to his master Saul.”) 
\v 20 When David went to Ziklag, these men of Manasseh defected to him: 
\b
\li1 Adnah, Jozabad, Jediael, Michael, Jozabad, Elihu, and Zillethai, chiefs of thousands in Manasseh. 
\b
\m 
\v 21 They helped David against the raiders, for they were all mighty men of valor and commanders in the army. 
\b
\m 
\v 22 For at that time men came to David day after day to help him, until he had a great army, like the army of God. 
\s1 David’s Army Grows at Hebron
\b
\m 
\v 23 Now these are the numbers of men armed for battle who came to David at Hebron to turn Saul’s kingdom over to him, in accordance with the word of the LORD: 
\b
\pmo 
\v 24 From Judah: 6,800 armed troops bearing shields and spears. 
\b
\pmo 
\v 25 From Simeon: 7,100 mighty men of valor, ready for battle. 
\b
\pmo 
\v 26 From Levi: 4,600, 
\v 27 including Jehoiada, leader of the house of Aaron, with 3,700 men, 
\v 28 and Zadok, a mighty young man of valor, with 22 commanders from his own family. 
\b
\pmo 
\v 29 From Benjamin, the kinsmen of Saul: 3,000, most of whom had remained loyal to the house of Saul up to that time. 
\b
\pmo 
\v 30 From Ephraim: 20,800 mighty men of valor, famous among their own clans. 
\b
\pmo 
\v 31 From the half-tribe of Manasseh:\f + \fr 12:31 \ft That is, the half-tribe of Manasseh west of the Jordan\f* 18,000 designated by name to come and make David king. 
\b
\pmo 
\v 32 From Issachar, men who understood the times and knew what Israel should do: 200 chiefs with all their kinsmen at their command. 
\b
\pmo 
\v 33 From Zebulun: 50,000 fit for service, trained for battle with all kinds of weapons of war, who with one purpose were devoted to David.\f + \fr 12:33 \ft LXX; Hebrew does not include to David.\f* 
\b
\pmo 
\v 34 From Naphtali: 1,000 commanders, accompanied by 37,000 men with shield and spear. 
\b
\pmo 
\v 35 From Dan: 28,600 prepared for battle. 
\b
\pmo 
\v 36 From Asher: 40,000 fit for service, prepared for battle. 
\b
\pmo 
\v 37 And from east of the Jordan, from Reuben, Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh there: 120,000 armed with every kind of weapon of war. 
\b
\m 
\v 38 All these men of war, arrayed for battle, came to Hebron fully determined to make David king over all Israel. And all the rest of the Israelites were of one mind to make David king. 
\b
\m 
\v 39 They spent three days there eating and drinking with David, for their relatives had provided for them. 
\v 40 And their neighbors from as far away as Issachar, Zebulun, and Naphtali came bringing food on donkeys, camels, mules, and oxen—abundant supplies of flour, fig cakes and raisin cakes, wine and oil, oxen and sheep. Indeed, there was joy in Israel. 
\c 13
\s1 David Fetches the Ark
\r (2 Samuel 6:1–4)
\b
\m 
\v 1 Then David conferred with all his leaders, the commanders of hundreds and of thousands. 
\v 2 And he said to the whole assembly of Israel, “If it seems good to you, and if this is of the LORD our God, let us send word far and wide to the rest of our brothers in all the land of Israel, and also to the priests and Levites in their cities and pasturelands, so that they may join us. 
\v 3 Then let us bring back the ark of our God, for we did not inquire of Him \f + \fr 13:3 \ft Or of it\f* in the days of Saul.” 
\b
\m 
\v 4 And because this proposal seemed right to all the people, the whole assembly agreed to it. 
\v 5 So David assembled all Israel, from the River Shihor \f + \fr 13:5 \ft Hebrew from the Shihor\f* in Egypt to Lebo-hamath, to bring the ark of God from Kiriath-jearim. 
\b
\m 
\v 6 David and all Israel went up to Baalah of Judah (that is, Kiriath-jearim) to bring up from there the ark of God the LORD, who is enthroned between the cherubim—the ark that is called by the Name.\f + \fr 13:6 \ft Or the ark of God, which is called by the Name of the LORD who is enthroned between the cherubim; or the ark of God, the LORD, who is enthroned between the cherubim, where His Name is called\f* 
\v 7 So they carried the ark of God from the house of Abinadab on a new cart, with Uzzah and Ahio guiding the cart. 
\s1 Uzzah Touches the Ark
\r (2 Samuel 6:5–11)
\b
\m 
\v 8 David and all the Israelites were celebrating before God with all their might, with songs and on harps and lyres, with tambourines, cymbals, and trumpets. 
\b
\m 
\v 9 When they came to the threshing floor of Chidon,\f + \fr 13:9 \ft Chidon is a variant of Nacon; see 2 Samuel 6:6.\f* Uzzah reached out and took hold of the ark, because the oxen had stumbled. 
\v 10 And the anger of the LORD burned against Uzzah, and He struck him down because he had put his hand on the ark. So he died there before God. 
\b
\m 
\v 11 Then David became angry because the LORD had burst forth against Uzzah; so he named that place Perez-uzzah,\f + \fr 13:11 \ft Perez-uzzah means outbreak against Uzzah.\f* as it is called to this day. 
\b
\m 
\v 12 That day David feared God and asked, “How can I ever bring the ark of God to me?” 
\v 13 So he did not move the ark with him to the City of David; instead, he took it aside to the house of Obed-edom the Gittite. 
\v 14 Thus the ark of God remained with the family of Obed-edom in his house for three months, and the LORD blessed his household and everything he owned. 
\c 14
\s1 David’s Family Grows
\r (2 Samuel 5:12–16)
\b
\m 
\v 1 Now Hiram king of Tyre sent envoys to David, along with cedar logs, stonemasons, and carpenters, to build a palace for him. 
\v 2 And David realized that the LORD had established him as king over Israel and had highly exalted his kingdom for the sake of His people Israel. 
\b
\m 
\v 3 And David took more wives in Jerusalem and became the father of more sons and daughters. 
\v 4 These are the names of the children born to him in Jerusalem: Shammua,\f + \fr 14:4 \ft Shammua is a variant of Shimea; see 1 Chronicles 3:5.\f* Shobab, Nathan, Solomon, 
\v 5 Ibhar, Elishua, Elpelet, 
\v 6 Nogah, Nepheg, Japhia, 
\v 7 Elishama, Beeliada,\f + \fr 14:7 \ft Beeliada is a variant of Eliada; see 2 Samuel 5:16.\f* and Eliphelet. 
\s1 Two Victories over the Philistines
\r (2 Samuel 5:17–25)
\b
\m 
\v 8 When the Philistines heard that David had been anointed king over all Israel, they all went in search of him; but David learned of this and went out to face them. 
\b
\m 
\v 9 Now the Philistines had come and raided the Valley of Rephaim. 
\v 10 So David inquired of God, “Should I go up against the Philistines? Will You deliver them into my hand?” 
\b
\m “Go,” replied the LORD, “for I will deliver them into your hand.” 
\b
\m 
\v 11 So David and his men went up to Baal-perazim, where he defeated the Philistines and said, “Like a bursting flood, God has burst out against my enemies by my hand.” So they called that place Baal-perazim.\f + \fr 14:11 \ft Baal-Perazim means The Lord Bursts Out.\f* 
\v 12 There the Philistines abandoned their gods, and David ordered that they be burned in the fire. 
\b
\m 
\v 13 Once again the Philistines raided the valley. 
\v 14 So David again inquired of God, who answered him, “Do not march up after them, but circle around them and attack them in front of the balsam trees.\f + \fr 14:14 \ft Or aspen trees or poplar trees; also in verse 15\f* 
\v 15 As soon as you hear the sound of marching in the tops of the balsam trees, move out to battle, because this will mean that God has marched out before you to strike the camp of the Philistines.” 
\b
\m 
\v 16 So David did as God had commanded him, and they struck down the army of the Philistines all the way from Gibeon to Gezer. 
\v 17 And David’s fame went out into every land, and the LORD caused all nations to fear him. 
\c 15
\s1 Preparing to Move the Ark
\r (2 Samuel 6:12–15)
\b
\m 
\v 1 David constructed buildings for himself in the City of David, and he prepared a place for the ark of God and pitched a tent for it. 
\v 2 Then David said, “No one but the Levites may carry the ark of God, because the LORD has chosen them to carry the ark of the LORD and to minister before Him forever.” 
\b
\m 
\v 3 And David assembled all Israel in Jerusalem to bring up the ark of the LORD to the place he had prepared for it. 
\v 4 Then he gathered together the descendants of Aaron and the Levites: 
\b
\li1 
\v 5 From the Kohathites, Uriel the chief and 120 of his relatives; 
\b
\li1 
\v 6 from the Merarites, Asaiah the chief and 220 of his relatives; 
\b
\li1 
\v 7 from the Gershomites,\f + \fr 15:7 \ft Gershomites is a variant of Gershonites; see 1 Chronicles 23:7.\f* Joel the chief and 130 of his relatives; 
\b
\li1 
\v 8 from the Elizaphanites, Shemaiah the chief and 200 of his relatives; 
\b
\li1 
\v 9 from the Hebronites, Eliel the chief and 80 of his relatives; 
\b
\li1 
\v 10 and from the Uzzielites, Amminadab the chief and 112 of his relatives. 
\b
\m 
\v 11 David summoned the priests Zadok and Abiathar and the Levites Uriel, Asaiah, Joel, Shemaiah, Eliel, and Amminadab. 
\v 12 And he said to them, “You are the heads of the Levitical families. You and your relatives must consecrate yourselves so that you may bring the ark of the LORD, the God of Israel, to the place I have prepared for it. 
\v 13 It was because you Levites were not with us the first time that the LORD our God burst forth in anger against us. For we did not consult Him about the proper order.” 
\s1 The Priests and Levites Carry the Ark
\b
\m 
\v 14 So the priests and Levites consecrated themselves to bring up the ark of the LORD, the God of Israel. 
\v 15 And the Levites carried the ark of God on their shoulders with the poles, as Moses had commanded in accordance with the word of the LORD. 
\b
\m 
\v 16 David also told the leaders of the Levites to appoint their relatives as singers to lift up their voices with joy, accompanied by musical instruments—harps, lyres, and cymbals. 
\v 17 So the Levites appointed Heman son of Joel; from his brothers, Asaph son of Berechiah; from their brothers the Merarites, Ethan son of Kushaiah; 
\v 18 and with them their brothers next in rank: Zechariah, \f + \fr 15:18 \ft Several Hebrew manuscripts and most LXX manuscripts (see also verse 20 and 1 Chronicles 16:5); most Hebrew manuscripts Zechariah son of or Zechariah, Ben, \f* Jaaziel, Shemiramoth, Jehiel, Unni, Eliab, Benaiah, Maaseiah, Mattithiah, Eliphelehu, Mikneiah, and the gatekeepers Obed-edom and Jeiel.\f + \fr 15:18 \ft Hebrew; some LXX manuscripts Obed-edom, Jeiel, and Azaziah or Obed-edom, Jeiel, and Ozias\f* 
\b
\m 
\v 19 The musicians Heman, Asaph, and Ethan were to sound the bronze cymbals. 
\v 20 Zechariah, Aziel,\f + \fr 15:20 \ft Aziel is a variant of Jaaziel; see verse 18.\f* Shemiramoth, Jehiel, Unni, Eliab, Maaseiah, and Benaiah were to play the harps according to Alamoth.\f + \fr 15:20 \ft Alamoth is probably a musical or liturgical term; here and in Psalm 46:1.\f* 
\v 21 And Mattithiah, Eliphelehu, Mikneiah, Obed-edom, Jeiel, and Azaziah were to lead the music with lyres according to Sheminith.\f + \fr 15:21 \ft Sheminith is probably a musical term; here and in Psalm 6:1 and Psalm 12:1.\f* 
\v 22 Chenaniah the head Levite was the director of the music because he was highly skilled. 
\b
\m 
\v 23 Berechiah and Elkanah were to be guardians \f + \fr 15:23 \ft Literally gatekeepers; also in verse 24\f* of the ark. 
\v 24 Shebaniah, Joshaphat, Nethanel, Amasai, Zechariah, Benaiah, and Eliezer—the priests—were to blow the trumpets before the ark of God. Obed-edom and Jehiah were also to be guardians of the ark. 
\s1 Moving the Ark to Jerusalem
\b
\m 
\v 25 So David, the elders of Israel, and the commanders of thousands went with rejoicing to bring the ark of the covenant of the LORD from the house of Obed-edom. 
\v 26 And because God helped the Levites who were carrying the ark of the covenant of the LORD, they sacrificed seven bulls and seven rams. 
\b
\m 
\v 27 Now David was dressed in a robe of fine linen, as were all the Levites who were carrying the ark, as well as the singers and Chenaniah, the director of music for the singers. David also wore a linen ephod. 
\v 28 So all Israel brought up the ark of the covenant of the LORD with shouting, with the sounding of rams’ horns and trumpets, and with cymbals and the music of harps and lyres. 
\s1 Michal’s Contempt for David
\r (2 Samuel 6:16)
\b
\m 
\v 29 As the ark of the covenant of the LORD was entering the City of David, Saul’s daughter Michal looked down from a window and saw King David dancing and celebrating, and she despised him in her heart. 
\c 16
\s1 A Tent for the Ark
\r (2 Samuel 6:17–19)
\b
\m 
\v 1 So they brought the ark of God and placed it inside the tent that David had pitched for it. And they presented burnt offerings and peace offerings before God. 
\v 2 When David had finished sacrificing the burnt offerings and peace offerings, he blessed the people in the name of the LORD. 
\v 3 Then he distributed to every man and woman of Israel a loaf of bread, a date cake,\f + \fr 16:3 \ft Or a portion of meat\f* and a raisin cake. 
\b
\m 
\v 4 David appointed some of the Levites to minister before the ark of the LORD, to celebrate, to give thanks, and to praise the LORD, the God of Israel. 
\v 5 Asaph was the chief, Zechariah was second, then Jeiel, Shemiramoth, Jehiel, Mattithiah, Eliab, Benaiah, Obed-edom, and Jeiel. They were to play the harps and lyres, while Asaph sounded the cymbals 
\v 6 and the priests Benaiah and Jahaziel blew the trumpets regularly before the ark of the covenant of God. 
\s1 David’s Psalm of Thanksgiving
\r (Psalm 105:1–15)
\b
\m 
\v 7 On that day David first committed to Asaph and his brothers this song of thanksgiving to the LORD: 
\b
\q1 
\v 8 “Give thanks to the LORD; call upon His name; 
\q2 make known His deeds among the nations. 
\q1 
\v 9 Sing to Him, sing praises to Him; 
\q2 tell of all His wonders. 
\q1 
\v 10 Glory in His holy name; 
\q2 let the hearts of those who seek the LORD rejoice. 
\q1 
\v 11 Seek out the LORD and His strength; 
\q2 seek His face always. 
\q1 
\v 12 Remember the wonders He has done, 
\q2 His marvels, and the judgments He has pronounced, 
\q1 
\v 13 O offspring of His servant Israel, 
\q2 O sons of Jacob, His chosen ones. 
\b
\q1 
\v 14 He is the LORD our God; 
\q2 His judgments carry throughout the earth. 
\q1 
\v 15 Remember \f + \fr 16:15 \ft Hebrew; some LXX manuscripts He remembers; see Psalm 105:8.\f* His covenant forever, 
\q2 the word He ordained for a thousand generations—
\q1 
\v 16 the covenant He made with Abraham, 
\q2 and the oath He swore to Isaac. 
\q1 
\v 17 He confirmed it to Jacob as a decree, 
\q2 to Israel as an everlasting covenant: 
\q1 
\v 18 ‘I will give you the land of Canaan 
\q2 as the portion of your inheritance.’ 
\b
\q1 
\v 19 When they were few in number, 
\q2 few indeed, and strangers in the land, 
\q1 
\v 20 they wandered from nation to nation, 
\q2 from one kingdom to another. 
\q1 
\v 21 He let no man oppress them; 
\q2 He rebuked kings on their behalf: 
\q1 
\v 22 ‘Do not touch My anointed ones! 
\q2 Do no harm to My prophets!’ 
\s1 Sing to the LORD, All the Earth
\r (Psalm 96:1–13)
\b
\q1 
\v 23 Sing to the LORD, all the earth. 
\q2 Proclaim His salvation day after day. 
\q1 
\v 24 Declare His glory among the nations, 
\q2 His wonderful deeds among all peoples. 
\b
\q1 
\v 25 For great is the LORD, and greatly to be praised; 
\q2 He is to be feared above all gods. 
\q1 
\v 26 For all the gods of the nations are idols, 
\q2 but it is the LORD who made the heavens. 
\q1 
\v 27 Splendor and majesty are before Him;

\q1 
\v 29 Ascribe to the LORD the glory due His name; 
\q2 bring an offering and come before Him. 
\q1 Worship the LORD in the splendor of His holiness; 
\q2 
\v 30 tremble before Him, all the earth. 
\q1 The world is firmly established; 
\q2 it cannot be moved. 
\b
\q1 
\v 31 Let the heavens be glad, 
\q2 and the earth rejoice. 
\q1 Let them say among the nations, 
\q2 ‘The LORD reigns!’ 
\q1 
\v 32 Let the sea resound, 
\q2 and all that fills it; 
\q1 let the fields exult, 
\q2 and all that is in them. 
\q1 
\v 33 Then the trees of the forest will sing for joy before the LORD, 
\q2 for He is coming to judge the earth. 
\b
\q1 
\v 34 Give thanks to the LORD, for He is good; 
\q2 His loving devotion \f + \fr 16:34 \ft Forms of the Hebrew chesed are translated here and in most cases throughout the Scriptures as loving devotion; the range of meaning includes love, goodness, kindness, faithfulness, and mercy, as well as loyalty to a covenant.\f* endures forever. 
\q1 
\v 35 Then cry out: ‘Save us, O God of our salvation; 
\q2 gather and deliver us from the nations, 
\q1 that we may give thanks to Your holy name, 
\q2 that we may glory in Your praise.’ 
\b
\q1 
\v 36 Blessed be the LORD, the God of Israel, 
\q2 from everlasting to everlasting.” 
\b
\m Then all the people said, “Amen!” and “Praise the LORD!” 
\s1 Worship before the Ark
\b
\m 
\v 37 So David left Asaph and his brothers there before the ark of the covenant of the LORD, to minister there regularly according to the daily requirements, 
\v 38 along with Obed-edom and his sixty-eight relatives. Obed-edom son of Jeduthun, and also Hosah, were to be gatekeepers. 
\b
\m 
\v 39 And David left Zadok the priest and his fellow priests before the tabernacle of the LORD at the high place in Gibeon 
\v 40 to regularly present burnt offerings to the LORD on the altar of burnt offerings, morning and evening, according to all that was written in the Law of the LORD, which He had commanded Israel to keep. 
\v 41 With them were Heman, Jeduthun, and the rest of those chosen and designated by name to give thanks to the LORD, for “His loving devotion endures forever.” 
\b
\m 
\v 42 Heman and Jeduthun had with them trumpets and cymbals for the music and instruments for the songs of God.\f + \fr 16:42 \ft Or instruments for the sacred music\f* And the sons of Jeduthun were stationed at the gate.

\s1 God’s Covenant with David
\r (2 Samuel 7:1–17)

\m 
\v 1 After David had settled into his palace, he said to Nathan the prophet, “Here I am, living in a house of cedar, while the ark of the covenant of the LORD is under a tent.” 
\b
\m 
\v 2 And Nathan replied to David, “Do all that is in your heart, for God is with you.”

\v 3 But that night the word of God came to Nathan, saying, 
\v 4 “Go and tell My servant David that this is what the LORD says: You are not the one to build Me a house in which to dwell. 
\v 5 For I have not dwelt in a house from the day I brought Israel up out of Egypt \f + \fr 17:5 \ft Out of Egypt is implied, but not included in the Hebrew; see 2 Samuel 7:6.\f* until this day, but I have moved from tent to tent and dwelling to dwelling. 
\v 6 In all My journeys with all the Israelites, have I ever asked any of the leaders \f + \fr 17:6 \ft Or judges; see verse 10.\f* I appointed to shepherd My people, ‘Why haven’t you built Me a house of cedar?’ 
\b
\m 
\v 7 Now then, you are to tell My servant David that this is what the LORD of Hosts says: I took you from the pasture, from following the flock, to be the ruler over My people Israel. 
\v 8 I have been with you wherever you have gone, and I have cut off all your enemies from before you. Now I will make for you a name like the greatest in the land. 
\b
\m 
\v 9 And I will provide a place for My people Israel and will plant them so that they may dwell in a place of their own and be disturbed no more. No longer will the sons of wickedness oppress them as they did at the beginning 
\v 10 and have done since the day I appointed judges over My people Israel. And I will subdue all your enemies. 
\b
\m Moreover, I declare to you that the LORD will build a house for you. 
\v 11 And when your days are fulfilled and you go to be with your fathers, I will raise up your descendant after you, one of your own sons, and I will establish his kingdom. 
\v 12 He will build a house for Me, and I will establish his throne forever. 
\v 13 I will be his Father, and he will be My son. And I will never remove My loving devotion from him as I removed it from your predecessor. 
\v 14 But I will set him over My house and My kingdom forever, and his throne will be established forever.” 
\b
\m 
\v 15 So Nathan relayed to David all the words of this entire vision. 
\s1 David’s Prayer of Thanksgiving
\r (2 Samuel 7:18–29)
\b
\m 
\v 16 Then King David went in, sat before the LORD, and said, “Who am I, O LORD God, and what is my house, that You have brought me this far? 
\v 17 And as if this was a small thing in Your eyes, O God, You have spoken about the future of the house of Your servant and have regarded me as a man of great distinction,\f + \fr 17:17 \ft Or and have shown me future generations\f* O LORD God. 
\v 18 What more can David say to You for so honoring Your servant? For You know Your servant, 
\v 19 O LORD.\f + \fr 17:19 \ft See 2 Samuel 7:20; many translators 18...For You know Your servant. 19 O LORD,\f* For the sake of Your servant and according to Your own heart, You have accomplished this great thing and revealed all Your greatness. 
\b
\m 
\v 20 O LORD, there is none like You, and there is no God but You, according to everything we have heard with our own ears. 
\v 21 And who is like Your people Israel—the one nation on earth whom God went out to redeem as a people for Himself? You made a name for Yourself through great and awesome wonders by driving out nations from before Your people, whom You redeemed from Egypt. 
\v 22 For You have made Your people Israel Your very own forever, and You, O LORD, have become their God. 
\b
\m 
\v 23 And now, O LORD, let the word You have spoken concerning Your servant and his house be established forever. Do as You have promised, 
\v 24 so that Your name will be established and magnified forever when it is said, ‘The LORD of Hosts, the God of Israel, is God over Israel.’ And may the house of Your servant David be established before You. 
\v 25 For You, my God, have revealed to Your servant that You will build a house for him. Therefore Your servant has found the courage to pray before You. 
\b
\m 
\v 26 And now, O LORD, You are God! And You have promised this goodness to Your servant. 
\v 27 So now You have been pleased to bless the house of Your servant, that it may continue forever before You. For You, O LORD, have blessed it, and it will be blessed forever.”

\s1 David’s Triumphs
\r (2 Samuel 8:1–14; Psalm 60:1–12)
\b
\m 
\v 1 Some time later, David defeated the Philistines, subdued them, and took Gath and its villages from the hand of the Philistines. 
\b
\m 
\v 2 David also defeated the Moabites, and they became subject to David and brought him tribute. 
\b
\m 
\v 3 As far as Hamath, David also defeated King Hadadezer of Zobah, who had marched out to establish his dominion \f + \fr 18:3 \ft Hebrew his hand\f* along the Euphrates River. 
\v 4 David captured from him a thousand chariots, seven thousand charioteers, and twenty thousand foot soldiers, and he hamstrung all the horses except a hundred he kept for the chariots. 
\b
\m 
\v 5 When the Arameans of Damascus came to help King Hadadezer of Zobah, David struck down twenty-two thousand men. 
\v 6 Then he placed garrisons \f + \fr 18:6 \ft LXX and Vulgate (see also 2 Samuel 8:6 and Syriac); Hebrew does not include garrisons.\f* in Aram of Damascus, and the Arameans became subject to David and brought him tribute. So the LORD made David victorious \f + \fr 18:6 \ft Or the LORD saved David; also in verse 13\f* wherever he went. 
\b
\m 
\v 7 And David took the gold shields that belonged to the officers of Hadadezer and brought them to Jerusalem. 
\v 8 And from Tibhath \f + \fr 18:8 \ft Tibhath is a variant of Tebah; see 2 Samuel 8:8 LXX.\f* and Cun, cities of Hadadezer, David took a large amount of bronze, with which Solomon made the bronze Sea, the pillars, and various bronze articles. 
\b
\m 
\v 9 When King Tou \f + \fr 18:9 \ft Tou is a variant of Toi; also in verse 10; see 2 Samuel 8:9.\f* of Hamath heard that David had defeated the entire army of Hadadezer king of Zobah, 
\v 10 he sent his son Hadoram \f + \fr 18:10 \ft Hadoram is a variant of Joram; see 2 Samuel 8:10.\f* to greet King David and bless him for fighting and defeating Hadadezer, who had been at war with Tou. Hadoram brought all kinds of articles of gold and silver and bronze, 
\v 11 and King David dedicated these to the LORD, along with the silver and gold he had carried off from all these nations—from Edom and Moab, and from the Ammonites, Philistines, and Amalekites. 
\b
\m 
\v 12 Moreover, Abishai son of Zeruiah struck down eighteen thousand Edomites in the Valley of Salt. 
\v 13 He placed garrisons in Edom, and all the Edomites were subject to David. So the LORD made David victorious wherever he went. 
\s1 David’s Officers
\r (2 Samuel 8:15–18)
\b
\m 
\v 14 Thus David reigned over all Israel and administered justice and righteousness for all his people: 
\b
\li1 
\v 15 Joab son of Zeruiah was over the army; 
\b
\li1 Jehoshaphat son of Ahilud was the recorder; 
\b
\li1 
\v 16 Zadok son of Ahitub and Ahimelech \f + \fr 18:16 \ft Some Hebrew manuscripts, Vulgate, and Syriac (see also 2 Samuel 8:17); most Hebrew manuscripts Abimelech\f* son of Abiathar were priests; 
\b
\li1 Shavsha \f + \fr 18:16 \ft Shavsha is also called Seraiah, Sheva, and Shisha; see 2 Samuel 8:17, 2 Samuel 20:25, and 1 Kings 4:3.\f* was the scribe; 
\b
\li1 
\v 17 Benaiah son of Jehoiada was over the Cherethites and Pelethites; 
\b
\li1 and David’s sons were chief officials at the king’s side. 
\c 19
\s1 David’s Messengers Disgraced
\r (2 Samuel 10:1–8)
\b
\m 
\v 1 Some time later, Nahash king of the Ammonites died and was succeeded by his son. 
\v 2 And David said, “I will show kindness to Hanun son of Nahash, because his father showed kindness to me.” 
\b
\m So David sent messengers to console Hanun concerning his father. But when David’s servants arrived in the land of the Ammonites to console him, 
\v 3 the princes of the Ammonites said to Hanun, “Just because David has sent you comforters, do you really believe he is showing respect for your father? Have not his servants come to you to explore the land, spy it out, and overthrow it?” 
\b
\m 
\v 4 So Hanun took David’s servants, shaved their beards, cut off their garments at the hips, and sent them away. 
\b
\m 
\v 5 When someone came and told David about his men, he sent messengers to meet them, since the men had been thoroughly humiliated. The king told them, “Stay in Jericho until your beards have grown back, and then return.” 
\b
\m 
\v 6 When the Ammonites realized that they had become a stench to David, Hanun and the Ammonites sent a thousand talents of silver \f + \fr 19:6 \ft 1,000 talents is approximately 37.7 tons or 34.2 metric tons of silver.\f* to hire for themselves chariots and horsemen from Aram-naharaim,\f + \fr 19:6 \ft That is, Mesopotamia; Aram-naharaim means Aram of the two rivers, likely the region between the Euphrates and Balih Rivers in northwestern Mesopotamia.\f* Aram-maacah, and Zobah. 
\v 7 So they hired for themselves thirty-two thousand chariots, as well as the king of Maacah with his troops, who came and camped near Medeba while the Ammonites came from their cities and marched out for battle. 
\b
\m 
\v 8 On hearing this, David sent Joab and the entire army of mighty men. 
\v 9 The Ammonites marched out and arrayed themselves for battle at the entrance to the city, while the kings who had come stayed by themselves in the open country. 
\s1 David Defeats Ammon and Aram
\r (2 Samuel 10:9–19)
\b
\m 
\v 10 When Joab saw the battle lines before him and behind him, he selected some of the best men of Israel and arrayed them against the Arameans. 
\v 11 And he placed the rest of the forces under the command of his brother Abishai, who arrayed them against the Ammonites. 
\b
\m 
\v 12 “If the Arameans are too strong for me,” said Joab, “then you will come to my rescue. And if the Ammonites are too strong for you, then I will come to your rescue. 
\v 13 Be strong and let us fight bravely for our people and for the cities of our God. May the LORD do what is good in His sight.” 
\b
\m 
\v 14 So Joab and his troops advanced to fight the Arameans, who fled before him. 
\v 15 When the Ammonites saw that the Arameans had fled, they too fled before Joab’s brother Abishai, and they entered the city. So Joab went back to Jerusalem. 
\b
\m 
\v 16 When the Arameans saw that they had been defeated by Israel, they sent messengers to bring more Arameans from beyond the Euphrates,\f + \fr 19:16 \ft Hebrew the River\f* with Shophach \f + \fr 19:16 \ft Shophach is a variant of Shobach; also in verse 18; see 2 Samuel 10:16.\f* the commander of Hadadezer’s army leading them. 
\b
\m 
\v 17 When this was reported to David, he gathered all Israel, crossed the Jordan, advanced toward the Arameans, and arrayed for battle against them. When David lined up to engage them in battle, they fought against him. 
\v 18 But the Arameans fled before Israel, and David killed seven thousand of their charioteers and forty thousand foot soldiers. He also killed Shophach the commander of their army. 
\b
\m 
\v 19 When Hadadezer’s subjects saw that they had been defeated by Israel, they made peace with David and became subject to him. So the Arameans were unwilling to help the Ammonites anymore. 
\c 20
\s1 The Capture of Rabbah
\r (2 Samuel 12:26–31)
\b
\m 
\v 1 In the spring,\f + \fr 20:1 \ft Literally At the turn of the year\f* at the time when kings march out to war, Joab led out the army and ravaged the land of the Ammonites. He came to Rabbah and besieged it, but David remained in Jerusalem. And Joab attacked Rabbah and demolished it. 
\b
\m 
\v 2 Then David took the crown from the head of their king.\f + \fr 20:2 \ft Or from the head of Milcom. Milcom, also called Molech, was god of the Ammonites; see Leviticus 18:21 and 1 Kings 11:7.\f* It was found to weigh a talent of gold \f + \fr 20:2 \ft A talent is approximately 75.4 pounds or 34.2 kilograms of gold.\f* and was set with precious stones, and it was placed on David’s head. And David took a great amount of plunder from the city. 
\b
\m 
\v 3 David brought out the people who were there and put them to work \f + \fr 20:3 \ft Or cut them\f* with saws, iron picks, and axes. And he did the same to all the Ammonite cities. Then David and all his troops returned to Jerusalem. 
\s1 Battles against the Philistines
\r (2 Samuel 21:15–22)
\b
\m 
\v 4 Some time later, war broke out with the Philistines at Gezer. At that time Sibbecai the Hushathite killed Sippai,\f + \fr 20:4 \ft Sippai is a variant of Saph; see 2 Samuel 21:18.\f* a descendant of the Rephaim,\f + \fr 20:4 \ft Or the giants; see also descendants of Rapha in verses 6 and 8.\f* and the Philistines were subdued. 
\b
\m 
\v 5 Once again there was a battle with the Philistines, and Elhanan son of Jair killed Lahmi the brother \f + \fr 20:5 \ft Or Elhanan son of Jair the Bethlehemite killed the brother; see 2 Samuel 21:19.\f* of Goliath the Gittite, the shaft of whose spear was like a weaver’s beam. 
\b
\m 
\v 6 And there was still another battle at Gath, where there was a man of great stature with six fingers on each hand and six toes on each foot—twenty-four in all. He too was descended from Rapha, 
\v 7 and when he taunted Israel, Jonathan the son of David’s brother Shimei killed him. 
\b
\m 
\v 8 So these descendants of Rapha in Gath fell at the hands of David and his servants. 
\c 21
\s1 David’s Military Census
\r (Exodus 30:11–16; 2 Samuel 24:1–9)
\b
\m 
\v 1 Then Satan \f + \fr 21:1 \ft That is, the Accuser or the Adversary\f* rose up against Israel and incited David to take a census of Israel. 
\v 2 So David said to Joab and the commanders of the troops, “Go and count the Israelites from Beersheba to Dan and bring me a report, so that I may know their number.” 
\b
\m 
\v 3 But Joab replied, “May the LORD multiply His troops a hundred times over. My lord the king, are they not all servants of my lord? Why does my lord want to do this? Why should he bring guilt on Israel?” 
\b
\m 
\v 4 Nevertheless, the king’s word prevailed against Joab. So Joab departed and traveled throughout Israel, and then he returned to Jerusalem. 
\v 5 And Joab reported to David the total number of the troops. In all Israel there were 1,100,000 men who drew the sword, including 470,000 in Judah. 
\v 6 But Joab did not include Levi and Benjamin in the count, because the king’s command was detestable to him. 
\s1 Judgment for David’s Sin
\r (2 Samuel 24:10–14)
\b
\m 
\v 7 This command was also evil in the sight of God; so He struck Israel. 
\b
\m 
\v 8 Then David said to God, “I have sinned greatly because I have done this thing. Now I beg You to take away the iniquity of Your servant, for I have acted very foolishly.” 
\b
\m 
\v 9 And the LORD instructed Gad, David’s seer, 
\v 10 “Go and tell David that this is what the LORD says: ‘I am offering you three options. Choose one of them, and I will carry it out against you.’” 
\b
\m 
\v 11 So Gad went and said to David, “This is what the LORD says: ‘You must choose 
\v 12 between three years of famine, three months of being swept away \f + \fr 21:12 \ft Hebrew; LXX and Vulgate of fleeing; see 2 Samuel 24:13.\f* before your enemies and overtaken by their swords, or three days of the sword of the LORD—days of plague upon the land, with the angel of the LORD ravaging every part of Israel.’ Now then, decide how I should reply to Him who sent me.” 
\b
\m 
\v 13 David answered Gad, “I am deeply distressed. Please, let me fall into the hand of the LORD, for His mercies are very great; but do not let me fall into the hands of men.” 
\s1 A Plague on Israel
\r (2 Samuel 24:15–17)
\b
\m 
\v 14 So the LORD sent a plague upon Israel, and seventy thousand men of Israel fell dead. 
\b
\m 
\v 15 Then God sent an angel to destroy Jerusalem, but as the angel was doing so, the LORD saw it and relented from the calamity, and He said to the angel who was destroying the people, “Enough! Withdraw your hand now!” 
\b
\m At that time the angel of the LORD was standing by the threshing floor of Ornan \f + \fr 21:15 \ft Ornan is a variant of Araunah; also in verses 18–28; see 2 Samuel 24:16.\f* the Jebusite. 
\b
\m 
\v 16 When David lifted up his eyes and saw the angel of the LORD standing between heaven and earth, with a drawn sword in his hand stretched out over Jerusalem, David and the elders, clothed in sackcloth, fell facedown. 
\v 17 And David said to God, “Was it not I who gave the order to count the people? I \f + \fr 21:17 \ft Or I, the shepherd, see 2 Samuel 24:17 DSS and LXX.\f* am the one who has sinned and acted wickedly. But these sheep, what have they done? O LORD my God, please let Your hand fall upon me and my father’s house, but do not let this plague remain upon Your people.” 
\s1 David Builds an Altar
\r (2 Samuel 24:18–25)
\b
\m 
\v 18 Then the angel of the LORD ordered Gad to tell David to go up and build an altar to the LORD on the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite. 
\v 19 So David went up at the word that Gad had spoken in the name of the LORD. 
\b
\m 
\v 20 Now Ornan was threshing wheat when he turned and saw the angel; and his four sons who were with him hid themselves. 
\v 21 David came to Ornan, and when Ornan looked out and saw David, he left the threshing floor and bowed facedown before David. 
\b
\m 
\v 22 Then David said to Ornan, “Grant me the site of this threshing floor, that I may build an altar to the LORD. Sell it to me for the full price, so that the plague upon the people may be halted.” 
\b
\m 
\v 23 Ornan said to David, “My lord the king may take whatever seems good. Look, I will give the oxen for the burnt offerings, the threshing sledges for the wood, and the wheat for the grain offering—I will give it all.” 
\b
\m 
\v 24 “No,” replied King David, “I insist on paying the full price, for I will not take for the LORD what belongs to you, nor will I offer burnt offerings that cost me nothing.” 
\b
\m 
\v 25 So David paid Ornan six hundred shekels of gold \f + \fr 21:25 \ft 600 shekels is approximately 15.1 pounds or 6.8 kilograms of gold.\f* for the site. 
\v 26 And there he built an altar to the LORD and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings. He called upon the LORD, who answered him with fire from heaven on the altar of burnt offering. 
\b
\m 
\v 27 Then the LORD spoke to the angel, who put his sword back into its sheath. 
\b
\m 
\v 28 At that time, when David saw that the LORD had answered him at the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite, he offered sacrifices there. 
\v 29 For the tabernacle of the LORD that Moses had made in the wilderness and the altar of burnt offering were presently at the high place in Gibeon, 
\v 30 but David could not go before it to inquire of God, because he was afraid of the sword of the angel of the LORD. 
\c 22
\s1 Preparations for the Temple
\b
\m 
\v 1 Then David said, “Here shall be the house of the LORD God, as well as the altar of burnt offering for Israel.” 
\b
\m 
\v 2 So David gave orders to gather the foreigners in the land of Israel, from whom he appointed stonecutters to prepare finished stones for building the house of God. 
\b
\m 
\v 3 David provided a large quantity of iron to make the nails for the doors of the gateways and for the fittings, together with more bronze than could be weighed 
\v 4 and more cedar logs than could be counted; for the Sidonians and Tyrians had brought a large quantity of cedar logs to David. 
\b
\m 
\v 5 And David said, “My son Solomon is young and inexperienced, and the house to be built for the LORD must be exceedingly magnificent—famous and glorious throughout all lands. Therefore I must make preparations for it.” So David made lavish preparations before his death. 
\s1 Solomon Anointed to Build the Temple
\b
\m 
\v 6 Then David called for his son Solomon and instructed him to build a house for the LORD, the God of Israel. 
\b
\m 
\v 7 “My son,” said David to Solomon, “it was in my heart to build a house for the Name of the LORD my God, 
\v 8 but this word of the LORD came to me: ‘You have shed much blood and waged great wars. You are not to build a house for My Name because you have shed so much blood on the ground before Me. 
\v 9 But a son will be born to you who will be a man of rest. I will give him rest from all his enemies on every side; for his name will be Solomon,\f + \fr 22:9 \ft Solomon sounds like and is probably derived from the Hebrew word for peace.\f* and I will grant to Israel peace and quiet during his reign. 
\v 10 He is the one who will build a house for My Name. He will be My son, and I will be his Father. And I will establish the throne of his kingdom over Israel forever.’ 
\b
\m 
\v 11 Now, my son, may the LORD be with you, and may you succeed in building the house of the LORD your God, as He said you would. 
\v 12 Above all, may the LORD give you insight and understanding when He puts you in command over Israel, so that you may keep the Law of the LORD your God. 
\v 13 Then you will succeed, if you carefully follow the statutes and ordinances that the LORD commanded Moses for Israel. Be strong and courageous. Do not be afraid or discouraged. 
\b
\m 
\v 14 Now behold, I have taken great pains to provide for the house of the LORD—100,000 talents of gold,\f + \fr 22:14 \ft 100,000 talents is approximately 3,770 tons or 3,420 metric tons of gold.\f* 1,000,000 talents of silver,\f + \fr 22:14 \ft 1,000,000 talents is approximately 37,700 tons or 34,200 metric tons of silver.\f* and bronze and iron too great to be weighed. I have also provided timber and stone, and you may add to them. 
\b
\m 
\v 15 You also have many workers: stonecutters, masons, carpenters, and men skilled in every kind of work—
\v 16 in gold and silver, bronze and iron—craftsmen beyond number. Now begin the work, and may the LORD be with you.” 
\b
\m 
\v 17 Then David ordered all the leaders of Israel to help his son Solomon: 
\v 18 “Is not the LORD your God with you, and has He not granted you rest on every side? For He has given the inhabitants of the land into my hand, and the land has been subdued before the LORD and His people. 
\v 19 Now set your heart and soul to seek the LORD your God. Get started building the sanctuary of the LORD God, so that you may bring the ark of the covenant of the LORD and the holy articles of God into the temple that will be built for the Name of the LORD.” 
\c 23
\s1 The Divisions of the Levites
\b
\m 
\v 1 When David was old and full of years, he installed his son Solomon as king over Israel. 
\v 2 Then he gathered all the leaders of Israel, as well as the priests and Levites. 
\b
\m 
\v 3 The Levites thirty years of age or older were counted, and the total number of men was 38,000. 
\v 4 “Of these,” said David,\f + \fr 23:4 \ft Hebrew does not include said David,\f* “24,000 are to oversee the work of the house of the LORD, 6,000 are to be officers and judges, 
\v 5 4,000 are to be gatekeepers, and 4,000 are to praise the LORD with the instruments I have made for giving praise.” 
\b
\m 
\v 6 Then David divided the Levites into divisions according to the sons of Levi: 
\b
\li1 Gershom, Kohath, and Merari. 
\s1 The Gershonites
\r (Numbers 3:21–26; Numbers 4:21–28)
\b
\li1 
\v 7 The Gershonites: Ladan \f + \fr 23:7 \ft Ladan is a variant of Libni; also in verses 8 and 9; see 1 Chronicles 6:17.\f* and Shimei. 
\b
\li1 
\v 8 The sons of Ladan: Jehiel \f + \fr 23:8 \ft Jehiel is a variant of Jehieli; see 1 Chronicles 26:21.\f* the first, Zetham, and Joel—three in all. 
\b
\li1 
\v 9 The sons of Shimei: Shelomoth, Haziel, and Haran—three in all. These were the heads of the families of Ladan. 
\b
\li1 
\v 10 And the sons of Shimei:\f + \fr 23:10 \ft Shimei was possibly a son or grandson of the Shimei listed in verse 9.\f* Jahath, Zina,\f + \fr 23:10 \ft Most Hebrew manuscripts; one Hebrew manuscript, LXX, and Vulgate (see also verse 11) Zizah\f* Jeush, and Beriah. These were the sons of Shimei—four in all. 
\v 11 Jahath was the first and Zizah was the second; but Jeush and Beriah did not have many sons, so they were counted as one family and received a single assignment. 
\s1 The Kohathites
\r (Numbers 3:27–32; Numbers 4:1–20)
\b
\li1 
\v 12 The sons of Kohath: Amram, Izhar, Hebron, and Uzziel—four in all. 
\b
\li1 
\v 13 The sons of Amram: Aaron and Moses. Aaron and his descendants were set apart forever to consecrate the most holy things, to burn incense before the LORD, to minister before Him, and to pronounce blessings in His name forever. 
\v 14 As for Moses the man of God, his sons were named among the tribe of Levi. 
\b
\li1 
\v 15 The sons of Moses: Gershom and Eliezer. 
\b
\li1 
\v 16 The descendants of Gershom: Shebuel was the first. 
\b
\li1 
\v 17 The descendants of Eliezer: Rehabiah was the first. Eliezer did not have any other sons, but the sons of Rehabiah were very numerous. 
\b
\li1 
\v 18 The sons of Izhar: Shelomith was the first. 
\b
\li1 
\v 19 The sons of Hebron: Jeriah was the first, Amariah the second, Jahaziel the third, and Jekameam the fourth. 
\b
\li1 
\v 20 The sons of Uzziel: Micah was the first and Isshiah the second. 
\s1 The Merarites
\r (Numbers 3:33–37; Numbers 4:29–33)

\s1 Levite Duties Revised
\b
\m 
\v 24 These were the descendants of Levi by their families—the heads of families, registered individually by name—those twenty years of age or older who worked in the service of the house of the LORD. 
\b
\m 
\v 25 For David had said, “The LORD, the God of Israel, has given rest to His people and has come to dwell in Jerusalem forever. 
\v 26 So now the Levites no longer need to carry the tabernacle or any of the articles for its service.” 
\b
\m 
\v 27 For according to the final instructions of David, the Levites twenty years of age or older were counted, 
\v 28 but their duty was to assist the descendants of Aaron with the service of the house of the LORD, being responsible for the courts and chambers, the purification of all the holy things, and the work of the service of the house of God, 
\v 29 as well as for the rows of the showbread, the fine flour for the grain offering, the wafers of unleavened bread, the baking, the mixing, and all measurements of quantity and size. 
\b
\m 
\v 30 They were also to stand every morning to give thanks and praise to the LORD, and likewise in the evening. 
\v 31 Whenever burnt offerings were presented to the LORD on the Sabbaths, New Moons, and appointed feasts, they were to serve regularly before the LORD in the numbers prescribed for them. 
\v 32 So the Levites were to carry out the responsibilities for the Tent of Meeting and the Holy Place, and, under their brothers the descendants of Aaron, the service of the house of the LORD. 
\c 24
\s1 Twenty-Four Divisions of Priests
\b
\m 
\v 1 These were the divisions of the descendants of Aaron. The sons of Aaron were Nadab, Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar. 
\v 2 But Nadab and Abihu died before their father did, and they had no sons; so Eleazar and Ithamar served as priests. 
\b
\m 
\v 3 With the help of Eleazar’s descendant Zadok and Ithamar’s descendant Ahimelech, David divided them according to the offices of their service. 
\v 4 Since more leaders were found among Eleazar’s descendants than those of Ithamar, they were divided accordingly. There were sixteen heads of families from the descendants of Eleazar and eight from the descendants of Ithamar. 
\b
\m 
\v 5 Thus they were divided by lot, for there were officers of the sanctuary and officers of God among both Eleazar’s and Ithamar’s descendants. 
\b
\m 
\v 6 The scribe, Shemaiah son of Nethanel, a Levite, recorded their names in the presence of the king and of the officers: Zadok the priest, Ahimelech son of Abiathar, and the heads of families of the priests and the Levites—one family being taken from Eleazar, and then one from Ithamar.

\b
\m 
\v 2 Then King David rose to his feet and said, “Listen to me, my brothers and my people. It was in my heart to build a house as a resting place for the ark of the covenant of the LORD and as a footstool for our God. I had made preparations to build it, 
\v 3 but God said to me, ‘You are not to build a house for My Name, because you are a man of war who has spilled blood.’ 
\b
\m 
\v 4 Yet the LORD, the God of Israel, chose me out of all my father’s house to be king over Israel forever. For He chose Judah as leader, and from the house of Judah He chose my father’s household, and from my father’s sons He was pleased to make me king over all Israel. 
\v 5 And of all my sons—for the LORD has given me many sons—He has chosen Solomon my son to sit on the throne of the kingdom of the LORD over Israel. 
\v 6 And He said to me, ‘Solomon your son is the one who will build My house and My courts, for I have chosen him as My son, and I will be his Father. 
\v 7 I will establish his kingdom forever, if he resolutely carries out My commandments and ordinances, as is being done this day.’ 
\b

\v 8 So now in the sight of all Israel, the assembly of the LORD, and in the hearing of our God, keep and seek out all the commandments of the LORD your God, so that you may possess this good land and leave it as an inheritance to your descendants forever. 
\v 9 As for you, Solomon my son, know the God of your father and serve Him wholeheartedly and with a willing mind, for the LORD searches every heart and understands the intent of every thought. If you seek Him, He will be found by you; but if you forsake Him, He will reject you forever. 
\v 10 Consider now that the LORD has chosen you to build a house for the sanctuary. Be strong and do it.” 
\s1 The Plans for the Temple
\b
\m 
\v 11 Then David gave his son Solomon the plans for the portico of the temple,\f + \fr 28:11 \ft LXX; Hebrew does not include of the temple.\f* its buildings, storehouses, upper rooms, inner rooms, and the room for the mercy seat.\f + \fr 28:11 \ft Or atonement cover\f* 
\v 12 The plans contained everything David had in mind \f + \fr 28:12 \ft Or had with him by the Spirit\f* for the courts of the house of the LORD, for all the surrounding rooms, for the treasuries of the house of God and of the dedicated things, 
\v 13 for the divisions of the priests and Levites, for all the work of service in the house of the LORD, and for all the articles of service in the house of the LORD: 
\b
\li1 
\v 14 the weight of all the gold articles for every kind of service; 
\b
\li1 the weight of all the silver articles for every kind of service; 
\b
\li1 
\v 15 the weight of the gold lampstands and their lamps, including the weight of each lampstand and its lamps; 
\b
\li1 the weight of each silver lampstand and its lamps, according to the use of each lampstand; 
\b
\li1 
\v 16 the weight of gold for each table of showbread, and of silver for the silver tables; 
\b
\li1 
\v 17 the weight of the pure gold for the forks, sprinkling bowls, and pitchers; 
\b
\li1 the weight of each gold dish; 
\b
\li1 the weight of each silver bowl; 
\b
\li1 
\v 18 the weight of the refined gold for the altar of incense; 
\b
\li1 and the plans for the chariot of the gold cherubim that spread their wings and overshadowed the ark of the covenant of the LORD. 
\b
\m 
\v 19 “All this,” said David, “all the details of this plan, the LORD has made clear to me in writing by His hand upon me.” 
\b
\m 
\v 20 David also said to Solomon his son, “Be strong and courageous, and do it. Do not be afraid or discouraged, for the LORD God, my God, is with you. He will neither fail you nor forsake you before all the work for the service of the house of the LORD is finished. 
\v 21 The divisions of the priests and Levites are ready for all the service of the house of God, and every willing man of every skill will be at your disposal for the work. The officials and all the people are fully at your command.”

\s1 Offerings for the Temple
\b
\m 
\v 1 Then King David said to the whole assembly, “My son Solomon, the one whom God has chosen, is young and inexperienced. The task is great because this palace is not for man, but for the LORD God. 
\v 2 Now with all my ability I have made provision for the house of my God—gold for the gold articles, silver for the silver, bronze for the bronze, iron for the iron, and wood for the wood, as well as onyx for the settings, turquoise, stones of various colors, all kinds of precious stones, and slabs of marble—all in abundance. 
\b
\m 
\v 3 Moreover, because of my delight in the house of my God, I now give for it my personal treasures of gold and silver, over and above all that I have provided for this holy temple: 
\v 4 three thousand talents of gold \f + \fr 29:4 \ft 3,000 talents is approximately 113 tons or 103 metric tons of gold.\f* (the gold of Ophir) and seven thousand talents of refined silver,\f + \fr 29:4 \ft 7,000 talents is approximately 264 tons or 239.5 metric tons of silver.\f* to overlay the walls of the buildings, 
\v 5 for the gold work and the silver work, and for all the work to be done by the craftsmen. Now who will volunteer to consecrate himself to the LORD today?” 
\b
\m 
\v 6 Then the leaders of the households, the officers of the tribes of Israel, the commanders of thousands and of hundreds, and the officials in charge of the king’s work gave willingly. 
\v 7 Toward the service of God’s house they gave 5,000 talents \f + \fr 29:7 \ft 5,000 talents is approximately 188.5 tons or 171 metric tons of gold.\f* and 10,000 darics of gold,\f + \fr 29:7 \ft Or 10,000 gold drachmas; that is, approximately 185.2 pounds or 84 kilograms of gold coins\f* 10,000 talents of silver,\f + \fr 29:7 \ft 10,000 talents is approximately 377 tons or 342 metric tons of silver.\f* 18,000 talents of bronze,\f + \fr 29:7 \ft 18,000 talents is approximately 678.6 tons or 615.6 metric tons of bronze.\f* and 100,000 talents of iron.\f + \fr 29:7 \ft 100,000 talents is approximately 3,770 tons or 3,420 metric tons of iron.\f* 
\v 8 Whoever had precious stones gave them to the treasury of the house of the LORD, under the care of Jehiel \f + \fr 29:8 \ft Jehiel is a variant of Jehieli; see 1 Chronicles 26:21.\f* the Gershonite. 
\v 9 And the people rejoiced at the willing response of their leaders, for they had given to the LORD freely and wholeheartedly. And King David also rejoiced greatly. 
\s1 David’s Prayer of Blessing
\b
\m 
\v 10 Then David blessed the LORD in the sight of all the assembly and said: 
\b
\pmo “May You be blessed, O LORD, God of our father Israel, from everlasting to everlasting. 
\b
\pmo 
\v 11 Yours, O LORD, is the greatness and the power and the glory and the splendor and the majesty, for everything in heaven and on earth belongs to You. 
\b
\pmo Yours, O LORD, is the kingdom, and You are exalted as head over all. 
\v 12 Both riches and honor come from You, and You are the ruler over all. In Your hands are power and might to exalt and give strength to all. 
\b
\pmo 
\v 13 Now therefore, our God, we give You thanks, and we praise Your glorious name. 
\v 14 But who am I, and who are my people, that we should be able to give as generously as this? For everything comes from You, and from Your own hand we have given to You. 
\v 15 For we are foreigners and strangers in Your presence, as were all our forefathers. Our days on earth are like a shadow, without hope. 
\b
\pmo 
\v 16 O LORD our God, from Your hand comes all this abundance that we have provided to build You a house for Your holy Name, and all of it belongs to You. 
\v 17 I know, my God, that You test the heart and delight in uprightness. All these things I have given willingly and with an upright heart, and now I have seen Your people who are present here giving joyfully and willingly to You. 
\b
\pmo 
\v 18 O LORD, God of our fathers Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, keep this desire forever in the intentions of the hearts of Your people, and direct their hearts toward You. 
\v 19 And give my son Solomon a whole heart to keep and carry out all Your commandments, decrees, and statutes, and to build Your palace for which I have made provision.” 
\b
\m 
\v 20 Then David said to the whole assembly, “Blessed be the LORD your God.” 
\b
\m So the whole assembly blessed the LORD, the God of their fathers. They bowed down and paid homage to the LORD and to the king. 
\s1 Solomon Anointed King
\r (1 Kings 1:32–40)
\b
\m 
\v 21 The next day they offered sacrifices and presented burnt offerings to the LORD: a thousand bulls, a thousand rams, and a thousand lambs, along with their drink offerings, and other sacrifices in abundance for all Israel. 
\v 22 That day they ate and drank with great joy in the presence of the LORD. 
\b
\m Then, for a second time, they designated David’s son Solomon as king, anointing him before the LORD as ruler, and Zadok as the priest. 
\b
\m 
\v 23 So Solomon sat on the throne of the LORD as king in place of his father David. He prospered, and all Israel obeyed him. 
\v 24 All the officials and mighty men, as well as all of King David’s sons, pledged their allegiance to King Solomon. 
\b
\m 
\v 25 The LORD highly exalted Solomon in the sight of all Israel and bestowed on him royal majesty such as had not been bestowed on any king in Israel before him. 
\s1 David’s Reign and Death
\r (1 Kings 2:10–12)
\b
\m 
\v 26 David son of Jesse was king over all Israel. 
\v 27 The length of David’s reign over Israel was forty years—seven years in Hebron and thirty-three years in Jerusalem. 
\v 28 He died at a ripe old age, full of years, riches, and honor, and his son Solomon reigned in his place. 
\b
\m 
\v 29 Now the acts of King David, from first to last, are indeed written in the Chronicles of Samuel the Seer, the Chronicles of Nathan the Prophet, and the Chronicles of Gad the Seer, 
\v 30 together with all the details of his reign, his might, and the circumstances that came upon him and Israel and all the kingdoms of the lands.
