\s1 Judah’s Rebellion
\r (2 Chronicles 28:5–15)
\b
\m 
\v 1 This is the vision concerning Judah and Jerusalem that Isaiah son of Amoz saw during the reigns of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah. 
\b
\q1 
\v 2 Listen, O heavens, and give ear, O earth, 
\q2 for the LORD has spoken: 
\b
\q1 “I have raised children and brought them up, 
\q2 but they have rebelled against Me. 
\q1 
\v 3 The ox knows its owner, 
\q2 and the donkey its master’s manger, 
\q1 but Israel does not know; 
\q2 My people do not understand.” 
\b
\q1 
\v 4 Alas, O sinful nation, 
\q2 a people laden with iniquity, 
\q1 a brood of evildoers, 
\q2 children of depravity! 
\q1 They have forsaken the LORD; 
\q2 they have despised the Holy One of Israel 
\q2 and turned their backs on Him. 
\b
\q1 
\v 5 Why do you want more beatings? 
\q2 Why do you keep rebelling? 
\q1 Your head has a massive wound, 
\q2 and your whole heart is afflicted. 
\q1 
\v 6 From the sole of your foot to the top of your head, 
\q2 there is no soundness—
\q1 only wounds and welts and festering sores 
\q2 neither cleansed nor bandaged nor soothed with oil. 
\b
\q1 
\v 7 Your land is desolate; 
\q2 your cities are burned with fire. 
\q1 Foreigners devour your fields before you—
\q2 a desolation demolished by strangers. 
\q1 
\v 8 And the Daughter of Zion is abandoned 
\q2 like a shelter in a vineyard, 
\q1 like a shack in a cucumber field, 
\q2 like a city besieged. 
\b
\q1 
\v 9 Unless the LORD of Hosts 
\q2 had left us a few survivors,\f + \fr 1:9 \ft LXX had left us descendants\f* 
\q1 we would have become like Sodom, 
\q2 we would have resembled Gomorrah.\f + \fr 1:9 \ft Cited in Romans 9:29\f* 
\s1 Meaningless Offerings
\b
\q1 
\v 10 Hear the word of the LORD, 
\q2 you rulers of Sodom; 
\q1 listen to the instruction of our God, 
\q2 you people of Gomorrah! 
\b
\q1 
\v 11 “What good to Me is your multitude of sacrifices?” 
\q2 says the LORD. 
\q1 “I am full from the burnt offerings of rams 
\q2 and the fat of well-fed cattle; 
\q1 I take no delight in the blood of bulls 
\q2 and lambs and goats. 
\q1 
\v 12 When you come to appear before Me, 
\q2 who has required this of you—
\q2 this trampling of My courts? 
\b
\q1 
\v 13 Bring your worthless offerings no more; 
\q2 your incense is detestable to Me—
\q2 your New Moons, Sabbaths, and convocations. 
\q1 I cannot endure iniquity 
\q2 in a solemn assembly. 
\q1 
\v 14 I hate your New Moons 
\q2 and your appointed feasts. 
\q1 They have become a burden to Me; 
\q2 I am weary of bearing them. 
\b
\q1 
\v 15 When you spread out your hands in prayer, 
\q2 I will hide My eyes from you; 
\q1 even though you multiply your prayers, 
\q2 I will not listen. 
\q2 Your hands are covered with blood. 
\b
\q1 
\v 16 Wash and cleanse yourselves. 
\q2 Remove your evil deeds from My sight. 
\q2 Stop doing evil! 
\q1 
\v 17 Learn to do right; 
\q2 seek justice and correct the oppressor.\f + \fr 1:17 \ft Or and encourage the oppressed\f* 
\q1 Defend the fatherless 
\q2 and plead the case of the widow.” 
\b
\q1 
\v 18 “Come now, let us reason together,” 
\q2 says the LORD. 
\q1 “Though your sins are like scarlet, 
\q2 they will be as white as snow; 
\q1 though they are as red as crimson, 
\q2 they will become like wool. 
\q1 
\v 19 If you are willing and obedient, 
\q2 you will eat the best of the land. 
\q1 
\v 20 But if you resist and rebel, 
\q2 you will be devoured by the sword.” 
\qr For the mouth of the LORD has spoken. 
\s1 The Corruption of Zion
\b
\q1 
\v 21 See how the faithful city has become a harlot! 
\q2 She once was full of justice; 
\q1 righteousness resided within her, 
\q2 but now only murderers! 
\q1 
\v 22 Your silver has become dross; 
\q2 your fine wine is diluted with water. 
\q1 
\v 23 Your rulers are rebels, 
\q2 friends of thieves. 
\q1 They all love bribes 
\q2 and chasing after rewards. 
\q1 They do not defend the fatherless, 
\q2 and the plea of the widow never comes before them. 
\b
\q1 
\v 24 Therefore the Lord GOD of Hosts, 
\q2 the Mighty One of Israel, declares: 
\b
\q1 “Ah, I will be relieved of My foes 
\q2 and avenge Myself on My enemies. 
\q1 
\v 25 I will turn My hand against you; 
\q2 I will thoroughly purge your dross; 
\q2 I will remove all your impurities. 
\q1 
\v 26 I will restore your judges as at first, 
\q2 and your counselors as at the beginning. 
\q1 After that you will be called the City of Righteousness, 
\q2 the Faithful City.” 
\b
\q1 
\v 27 Zion will be redeemed with justice, 
\q2 her repentant ones with righteousness. 
\q1 
\v 28 But rebels and sinners will together be shattered, 
\q2 and those who forsake the LORD will perish. 
\q1 
\v 29 Surely you will be ashamed of the sacred oaks 
\q2 in which you have delighted; 
\q1 you will be embarrassed by the gardens 
\q2 that you have chosen. 
\b
\q1 
\v 30 For you will become like an oak whose leaves are withered, 
\q2 like a garden without water. 
\q1 
\v 31 The strong man will become tinder 
\q2 and his work will be a spark; 
\q1 both will burn together, 
\q2 with no one to quench the flames.

\s1 The Mountain of the House of the LORD
\r (Micah 4:1–5)
\b
\m 
\v 1 This is the message that was revealed to Isaiah son of Amoz concerning Judah and Jerusalem: 
\b
\q1 
\v 2 In the last days the mountain of the house of the LORD 
\q2 will be established as the chief of the mountains; 
\q1 it will be raised above the hills, 
\q2 and all nations will stream to it. 
\b
\q1 
\v 3 And many peoples will come and say: 
\b
\q1 “Come, let us go up to the mountain of the LORD, 
\q2 to the house of the God of Jacob. 
\q1 He will teach us His ways 
\q2 so that we may walk in His paths.” 
\b
\q1 For the law will go forth from Zion, 
\q2 and the word of the LORD from Jerusalem. 
\q1 
\v 4 Then He will judge between the nations 
\q2 and arbitrate for many peoples. 
\q1 They will beat their swords into plowshares 
\q2 and their spears into pruning hooks. 
\q1 Nation will no longer take up the sword against nation, 
\q2 nor train anymore for war. 
\s1 The Day of Reckoning
\b
\q1 
\v 5 Come, O house of Jacob, 
\q2 let us walk in the light of the LORD. 
\q1 
\v 6 For You have abandoned Your people, 
\q2 the house of Jacob, 
\q1 because they are filled 
\q2 with influences from the east; 
\q1 they are soothsayers like the Philistines; 
\q2 they strike hands with the children of foreigners. 
\b
\q1 
\v 7 Their land is full of silver and gold, 
\q2 with no limit to their treasures; 
\q1 their land is full of horses, 
\q2 with no limit to their chariots. 
\q1 
\v 8 Their land is full of idols; 
\q2 they bow down to the work of their hands, 
\q2 to what their fingers have made. 
\q1 
\v 9 So mankind is brought low, 
\q2 and man is humbled—
\q2 do not forgive them! 
\b
\q1 
\v 10 Go into the rocks 
\q2 and hide in the dust 
\q1 from the terror of the LORD 
\q2 and the splendor of His majesty. 
\q1 
\v 11 The proud look of man will be humbled, 
\q2 and the loftiness of men brought low; 
\q2 the LORD alone will be exalted in that day. 
\b
\q1 
\v 12 For the Day of the LORD of Hosts 
\q2 will come against all the proud and lofty, 
\q1 against all that is exalted—
\q2 it will be humbled—
\q1 
\v 13 against all the cedars of Lebanon, lofty and lifted up, 
\q2 against all the oaks of Bashan, 
\q1 
\v 14 against all the tall mountains, 
\q2 against all the high hills, 
\q1 
\v 15 against every high tower, 
\q2 against every fortified wall, 
\q1 
\v 16 against every ship of Tarshish,\f + \fr 2:16 \ft Or every ship of trade\f* 
\q2 and against every stately vessel. 
\b
\q1 
\v 17 So the pride of man will be brought low, 
\q2 and the loftiness of men will be humbled; 
\q1 the LORD alone will be exalted in that day, 
\q2 
\v 18 and the idols will vanish completely. 
\q1 
\v 19 Men will flee to caves in the rocks 
\q2 and holes in the ground, 
\q1 away from the terror of the LORD 
\q2 and from the splendor of His majesty, 
\q2 when He rises to shake the earth. 
\b
\q1 
\v 20 In that day men will cast away 
\q2 to the moles and bats 
\q1 their idols of silver and gold—
\q2 the idols they made to worship. 
\q1 
\v 21 They will flee to caverns in the rocks 
\q2 and crevices in the cliffs, 
\q1 away from the terror of the LORD 
\q2 and from the splendor of His majesty, 
\q2 when He rises to shake the earth. 
\b
\q1 
\v 22 Put no more trust in man, 
\q2 who has only the breath in his nostrils. 
\q2 Of what account is he? 
\c 3
\s1 Judgment on Jerusalem and Judah
\b
\q1 
\v 1 For behold, the Lord GOD of Hosts 
\q2 is about to remove 
\q1 from Jerusalem and Judah 
\q2 both supply \f + \fr 3:1 \ft Hebrew staff\f* and support: 
\q1 the whole supply of food and water, 
\q2 
\v 2 the mighty man and the warrior, 
\q1 the judge and the prophet, 
\q2 the soothsayer and the elder, 
\q1 
\v 3 the commander of fifty and the dignitary, 
\q2 the counselor, the cunning magician, and the clever enchanter. 
\b
\q1 
\v 4 “I will make mere lads their leaders, 
\q2 and children will rule over them.” 
\b
\q1 
\v 5 The people will oppress one another, 
\q2 man against man, neighbor against neighbor; 
\q1 the young will rise up against the old, 
\q2 and the base against the honorable. 
\b
\q1 
\v 6 A man will seize his brother 
\q2 within his father’s house: 
\q1 “You have a cloak—you be our leader! 
\q2 Take charge of this heap of rubble.” 
\b
\q1 
\v 7 On that day he will cry aloud: 
\q2 “I am not a healer.\f + \fr 3:7 \ft Or binder of wounds\f* 
\q1 I have no food or clothing in my house. 
\q2 Do not make me leader of the people!” 
\b
\q1 
\v 8 For Jerusalem has stumbled 
\q2 and Judah has fallen 
\q1 because they spoke and acted against the LORD, 
\q2 defying His glorious presence.\f + \fr 3:8 \ft Hebrew defying the eyes of His glory\f* 
\q1 
\v 9 The expression on their faces testifies against them, 
\q2 and like Sodom they flaunt their sin; 
\q2 they do not conceal it. 
\q1 Woe to them, 
\q2 for they have brought disaster upon themselves. 
\b
\q1 
\v 10 Tell the righteous it will be well with them, 
\q2 for they will enjoy the fruit of their labor. 
\q1 
\v 11 Woe to the wicked; disaster is upon them! 
\q2 For they will be repaid with what their hands have done. 
\q1 
\v 12 Youths oppress My people, 
\q2 and women rule over them. 
\q1 O My people, your guides mislead you; 
\q2 they turn you from your paths. 
\b
\q1 
\v 13 The LORD arises to contend; 
\q2 He stands to judge the people. 
\q1 
\v 14 The LORD brings this charge 
\q2 against the elders and leaders of His people: 
\q1 “You have devoured the vineyard; 
\q2 the plunder of the poor is in your houses. 
\q1 
\v 15 Why do you crush My people 
\q2 and grind the faces of the poor?” 
\qr declares the Lord GOD of Hosts. 
\s1 A Warning to the Daughters of Zion
\b
\q1 
\v 16 The LORD also says: 
\b
\q1 “Because the daughters of Zion are haughty—
\q2 walking with heads held high 
\q2 and wanton eyes, 
\q1 prancing and skipping as they go, 
\q2 jingling the bracelets on their ankles—
\q1 
\v 17 the Lord will bring sores 
\q2 on the heads of the daughters of Zion, 
\q2 and the LORD will make their foreheads bare.\f + \fr 3:17 \ft Or will uncover their secret parts\f*” 
\b
\q1 
\v 18 In that day the Lord will take away their finery: 
\q2 their anklets and headbands and crescents; 
\q1 
\v 19 their pendants, bracelets, and veils; 
\q2 
\v 20 their headdresses, ankle chains, and sashes; 
\q1 their perfume bottles and charms; 
\q2 
\v 21 their signet rings and nose rings; 
\q1 
\v 22 their festive robes, capes, cloaks, and purses; 
\q2 
\v 23 and their mirrors, linen garments, tiaras, and shawls. 
\b
\q1 
\v 24 Instead of fragrance 
\q2 there will be a stench; 
\q1 instead of a belt, a rope; 
\q2 instead of styled hair, baldness; 
\q1 instead of fine clothing, sackcloth; 
\q2 instead of beauty, shame.\f + \fr 3:24 \ft DSS; MT branding\f* 
\b
\q1 
\v 25 Your men will fall by the sword, 
\q2 and your warriors in battle. 
\q1 
\v 26 And the gates of Zion will lament and mourn; 
\q2 destitute, she will sit on the ground. 
\c 4
\s1 A Remnant in Zion
\b
\q1 
\v 1 In that day seven women 
\q2 will take hold of one man and say, 
\q1 “We will eat our own bread 
\q2 and provide our own clothes. 
\q1 Just let us be called by your name. 
\q2 Take away our disgrace!” 
\b
\q1 
\v 2 On that day the Branch of the LORD 
\q2 will be beautiful and glorious, 
\q1 and the fruit of the land 
\q2 will be the pride and glory of Israel’s survivors. 
\q1 
\v 3 Whoever remains in Zion 
\q2 and whoever is left in Jerusalem 
\q1 will be called holy—
\q2 all in Jerusalem who are recorded among the living—
\q1 
\v 4 when the Lord has washed away 
\q2 the filth of the daughters of Zion 
\q1 and cleansed the bloodstains from the heart of Jerusalem 
\q2 by a spirit of judgment and a spirit of fire. 
\b
\q1 
\v 5 Then the LORD will create over all of Mount Zion 
\q2 and over her assemblies 
\q1 a cloud of smoke by day 
\q2 and a glowing flame of fire by night. 
\q1 For over all the glory 
\q2 there will be a canopy, 
\q1 
\v 6 a shelter to give shade 
\q2 from the heat by day, 
\q1 and a refuge and hiding place 
\q2 from the storm and the rain. 
\c 5
\s1 The Song of the Vineyard
\r (Luke 13:6–9)
\b
\q1 
\v 1 I will sing for my beloved a song of his vineyard: 
\b
\q1 My beloved had a vineyard 
\q2 on a very fertile hill. 
\q1 
\v 2 He dug it up and cleared the stones 
\q2 and planted the finest vines. 
\q1 He built a watchtower in the middle 
\q2 and dug out a winepress as well. 
\b
\q1 He waited for the vineyard to yield good grapes, 
\q2 but the fruit it produced was sour! 
\b
\q1 
\v 3 “And now, O dwellers of Jerusalem 
\q2 and men of Judah, 
\q1 I exhort you to judge 
\q2 between Me and My vineyard. 
\q1 
\v 4 What more could I have done for My vineyard 
\q2 than I already did for it? 
\q1 Why, when I expected sweet grapes, 
\q2 did it bring forth sour fruit? 
\b
\q1 
\v 5 Now I will tell you what I am about to do to My vineyard: 
\b
\q1 I will take away its hedge, 
\q2 and it will be consumed; 
\q1 I will tear down its wall, 
\q2 and it will be trampled. 
\q1 
\v 6 I will make it a wasteland, 
\q2 neither pruned nor cultivated, 
\q2 and thorns and briers will grow up. 
\q1 I will command the clouds 
\q2 that rain shall not fall on it.” 
\b
\q1 
\v 7 For the vineyard of the LORD of Hosts 
\q2 is the house of Israel, 
\q1 and the men of Judah 
\q2 are the plant of His delight. 
\q1 He looked for justice, 
\q2 but saw bloodshed; 
\q1 for righteousness, 
\q2 but heard a cry of distress. 
\s1 Woes to the Wicked
\b
\q1 
\v 8 Woe to you who add house to house 
\q2 and join field to field 
\q1 until no place is left 
\q2 and you live alone in the land. 
\b
\q1 
\v 9 I heard the LORD of Hosts declare: 
\b
\q1 “Surely many houses will become desolate, 
\q2 great mansions left unoccupied. 
\q1 
\v 10 For ten acres of vineyard 
\q2 will yield but a bath of wine,\f + \fr 5:10 \ft Literally ten yoke of vineyard will yield a bath; that is, the area ten yoke of oxen can plow in a day will yield approximately 5.8 gallons or 22 liters of wine.\f* 
\q1 and a homer of seed 
\q2 only an ephah of grain.\f + \fr 5:10 \ft Literally and a homer of seed will yield an ephah; that is, a homer of seed (approximately 6.24 bushels or 220 liters) will yield a tenth of its weight in grain.\f*” 
\b
\q1 
\v 11 Woe to those who rise early in the morning 
\q2 in pursuit of strong drink, 
\q1 who linger into the evening, 
\q2 to be inflamed by wine. 
\q1 
\v 12 At their feasts are the lyre and harp, 
\q2 tambourines and flutes and wine. 
\q1 They disregard the actions of the LORD 
\q2 and fail to see the work of His hands. 
\b
\q1 
\v 13 Therefore My people will go into exile 
\q2 for their lack of understanding; 
\q1 their dignitaries are starving 
\q2 and their masses are parched with thirst. 
\q1 
\v 14 Therefore Sheol enlarges its throat 
\q2 and opens wide its enormous jaws, 
\q1 and down go Zion’s nobles and masses, 
\q2 her revelers and carousers! 
\b
\q1 
\v 15 So mankind will be brought low, and each man humbled; 
\q2 the arrogant will lower their eyes. 
\q1 
\v 16 But the LORD of Hosts will be exalted by His justice, 
\q2 and the holy God will show Himself holy in righteousness. 
\q1 
\v 17 Lambs will graze as in their own pastures, 
\q2 and strangers \f + \fr 5:17 \ft LXX lambs\f* will feed in the ruins of the wealthy. 
\b
\q1 
\v 18 Woe to those who draw iniquity with cords of deceit 
\q2 and pull sin along with cart ropes, 
\q1 
\v 19 to those who say, “Let Him hurry and hasten His work 
\q2 so that we may see it! 
\q1 Let the plan of the Holy One of Israel come 
\q2 so that we may know it!” 
\b
\q1 
\v 20 Woe to those who call evil good 
\q2 and good evil, 
\q1 who turn darkness to light 
\q2 and light to darkness, 
\q1 who replace bitter with sweet 
\q2 and sweet with bitter. 
\b
\q1 
\v 21 Woe to those who are wise in their own eyes 
\q2 and clever in their own sight. 
\b
\q1 
\v 22 Woe to those who are heroes in drinking wine 
\q2 and champions in mixing beer, 
\q1 
\v 23 who acquit the guilty for a bribe 
\q2 and deprive the innocent of justice. 
\b
\q1 
\v 24 Therefore, as a tongue of fire consumes the straw, 
\q2 and as dry grass shrivels in the flame, 
\q1 so their roots will decay 
\q2 and their blossoms will blow away like dust; 
\q1 for they have rejected the instruction of the LORD of Hosts 
\q2 and despised the word of the Holy One of Israel. 
\q1 
\v 25 Therefore the anger of the LORD burns against His people; 
\q2 His hand is raised against them to strike them down. 
\q1 The mountains quake, 
\q2 and the corpses lay like refuse in the streets. 
\b
\q1 Despite all this, His anger is not turned away; 
\q2 His hand is still upraised. 
\b
\q1 
\v 26 He lifts a banner for the distant nations 
\q2 and whistles for those at the ends of the earth. 
\q2 Behold—how speedily and swiftly they come! 
\q1 
\v 27 None of them grows weary or stumbles; 
\q2 no one slumbers or sleeps. 
\q1 No belt is loose 
\q2 and no sandal strap is broken. 
\q1 
\v 28 Their arrows are sharpened, 
\q2 and all their bows are strung. 
\q1 The hooves of their horses are like flint; 
\q2 their chariot wheels are like a whirlwind. 
\q1 
\v 29 Their roaring is like that of a lion; 
\q2 they roar like young lions. 
\q1 They growl and seize their prey; 
\q2 they carry it away from deliverance. 
\q1 
\v 30 In that day they will roar over it, 
\q2 like the roaring of the sea. 
\q1 If one looks over the land, 
\q2 he will see darkness and distress; 
\q2 even the light will be obscured by clouds.

\s1 Isaiah’s Commission
\r (Matthew 13:10–17; Mark 4:10–12; Acts 28:16–31)
\b
\m 
\v 1 In the year that King Uzziah died, I saw the Lord seated on a throne, high and exalted; and the train of His robe \f + \fr 6:1 \ft Or the hem of His robe\f* filled the temple. 
\v 2 Above Him stood seraphim, each having six wings: With two wings they covered their faces, with two they covered their feet, and with two they were flying. 
\v 3 And they were calling out to one another: 
\b
\q1 “Holy, holy, holy is the LORD of Hosts; 
\q2 all the earth is full of His glory.” 
\b
\m 
\v 4 At the sound of their voices the doorposts and thresholds shook, and the temple was filled with smoke. 
\b
\m 
\v 5 Then I said: 
\b
\q1 “Woe is me, 
\q2 for I am ruined, 
\q1 because I am a man of unclean lips 
\q2 dwelling among a people of unclean lips; 
\q1 for my eyes have seen the King, 
\q2 the LORD of Hosts.” 
\b
\m 
\v 6 Then one of the seraphim flew to me, and in his hand was a glowing coal that he had taken with tongs from the altar. 
\v 7 And with it he touched my mouth and said: 
\b
\q1 “Now that this has touched your lips, 
\q2 your iniquity is removed 
\q2 and your sin is atoned for.” 
\b
\m 
\v 8 Then I heard the voice of the Lord saying: 
\b
\q1 “Whom shall I send? 
\q2 Who will go for Us?” 
\b
\m And I said: 
\b
\q1 “Here am I. Send me!” 
\b
\m 
\v 9 And He replied: 
\b
\q1 “Go and tell this people, 
\q2 ‘Be ever hearing, but never understanding; 
\q2 be ever seeing, but never perceiving.’\f + \fr 6:9 \ft Hebrew; LXX ‘You shall be ever hearing, but never understanding; you shall be ever seeing, but never perceiving.’ Cited in Matthew 13:14, Mark 4:12, Luke 8:10, and Acts 28:26\f* 
\q1 
\v 10 Make the hearts of this people calloused; 
\q2 deafen their ears and close their eyes. 
\q1 Otherwise they might see with their eyes, 
\q2 hear with their ears, 
\q2 understand with their hearts, 
\q1 and turn and be healed.\f + \fr 6:10 \ft Hebrew; LXX For this people’s heart has grown callous; they hardly hear with their ears, and they have closed their eyes. Otherwise they might see with their eyes, hear with their ears, understand with their hearts, and turn, and I would heal them. Cited in Matthew 13:15, Mark 4:12, John 12:40, and Acts 28:27\f*” 
\b
\m 
\v 11 Then I asked: 
\b
\q1 “How long, O Lord?” 
\b
\m And He replied: 
\b
\q1 “Until the cities lie ruined 
\q1 and without inhabitant, 
\q1 until the houses are left unoccupied 
\q2 and the land is desolate and ravaged, 
\q1 
\v 12 until the LORD has driven men far away 
\q2 and the land is utterly forsaken. 
\q1 
\v 13 And though a tenth remains in the land, 
\q2 it will be burned again. 
\q1 As the terebinth and oak leave stumps when felled, 
\q2 so the holy seed will be a stump in the land.”

\s1 A Message to Ahaz
\b
\m 
\v 1 Now in the days that Ahaz son of Jotham, the son of Uzziah, was king of Judah, Rezin king of Aram \f + \fr 7:1 \ft That is, Syria\f* marched up to wage war against Jerusalem. He was accompanied by Pekah son of Remaliah the king of Israel, but he could not overpower the city. 
\b
\m 
\v 2 When it was reported to the house of David that Aram was in league with Ephraim,\f + \fr 7:2 \ft Or had set up camp in Ephraim, that is, the northern kingdom of Israel\f* the hearts of Ahaz and his people trembled like trees in the forest shaken by the wind. 
\b
\m 
\v 3 Then the LORD said to Isaiah, “Go out with your son Shear-jashub \f + \fr 7:3 \ft Shear-jashub means a remnant shall return.\f* to meet Ahaz at the end of the aqueduct that feeds the upper pool, on the road to the Launderer’s Field, 
\v 4 and say to him: Calm down and be quiet. Do not be afraid or disheartened over these two smoldering stubs of firewood—over the fierce anger of Rezin and Aram and of the son of Remaliah. 
\v 5 For Aram, along with Ephraim and the son of Remaliah, has plotted your ruin, saying: 
\v 6 ‘Let us invade Judah, terrorize it, and divide it \f + \fr 7:6 \ft Hebrew split it open\f* among ourselves. Then we can install the son of Tabeal over it as king.’ 
\v 7 But this is what the Lord GOD says: 
\b
\q1 ‘It will not arise; 
\q2 it will not happen. 
\q1 
\v 8 For the head of Aram is Damascus, 
\q2 and the head of Damascus is Rezin. 
\q1 Within sixty-five years 
\q2 Ephraim will be shattered as a people. 
\q1 
\v 9 The head of Ephraim is Samaria, 
\q2 and the head of Samaria is the son of Remaliah. 
\q1 If you do not stand firm in your faith, 
\q2 then you will not stand at all.’” 
\s1 The Sign of Immanuel
\r (Matthew 1:18–25)
\b
\m 
\v 10 Again the LORD spoke to Ahaz, saying, 
\v 11 “Ask for a sign from the LORD your God, whether from the depths of Sheol or the heights of heaven.” 
\b
\m 
\v 12 But Ahaz replied, “I will not ask; I will not test the LORD.” 
\b
\m 
\v 13 Then Isaiah said, “Hear now, O house of David! Is it not enough to try the patience of men? Will you try the patience of my God as well? 
\v 14 Therefore the Lord Himself will give you a sign: Behold, the virgin \f + \fr 7:14 \ft Or young woman\f* will be with child and will give birth to a son, and will call Him Immanuel.\f + \fr 7:14 \ft Immanuel means God with us; literally and she will call His name Immanuel; DSS and His name will be called Immanuel or and he will call His name Immanuel; LXX you will call His name Immanuel; cited in Matthew 1:23.\f* 
\v 15 By the time He knows enough to reject evil and choose good, He will be eating curds and honey. 
\v 16 For before the boy knows enough to reject evil and choose good, the land of the two kings you dread will be laid waste. 
\s1 Judgment to Come
\r (Micah 1:1–7)
\b
\m 
\v 17 The LORD will bring on you and on your people and on the house of your father a time unlike any since the day Ephraim separated from Judah—He will bring the king of Assyria.” 
\b
\m 
\v 18 On that day the LORD will whistle to the flies at the farthest streams of the Nile and to the bees in the land of Assyria. 
\q1 
\v 19 And they will all come and settle 
\q2 in the steep ravines and clefts of the rocks, 
\q2 in all the thornbushes and watering holes. 
\b
\m 
\v 20 On that day the Lord will use a razor hired from beyond the Euphrates \f + \fr 7:20 \ft Hebrew the River\f*—the king of Assyria—to shave your head and the hair of your legs, and to remove your beard as well. 
\v 21 On that day a man will raise a young cow and two sheep, 
\v 22 and from the abundance of milk they give, he will eat curds; for all who remain in the land will eat curds and honey. 
\b
\m 
\v 23 And on that day, in every place that had a thousand vines worth a thousand shekels of silver,\f + \fr 7:23 \ft Hebrew a thousand of silver; that is, approximately 25.1 pounds or 11.4 kilograms of silver\f* only briers and thorns will be found. 
\v 24 Men will go there with bow and arrow, for the land will be covered with briers and thorns. 
\v 25 For fear of the briers and thorns, you will no longer traverse the hills once tilled by the hoe; they will become places for oxen to graze and sheep to trample. 
\c 8
\s1 Assyrian Invasion Prophesied
\b
\m 
\v 1 Then the LORD said to me, “Take a large scroll and write on it with an ordinary \f + \fr 8:1 \ft Hebrew with a man’s\f* stylus: Maher-shalal-hash-baz.\f + \fr 8:1 \ft Maher-shalal-hash-baz means The spoil speeds, the prey hastens or Swift to plunder, quick to carry away; also in verse 3.\f* 
\v 2 And I will appoint for Myself trustworthy witnesses—Uriah the priest and Zechariah son of Jeberekiah.” 
\b
\m 
\v 3 And I had relations with the prophetess, and she conceived and gave birth to a son. The LORD said to me, “Name him Maher-shalal-hash-baz. 
\v 4 For before the boy knows how to cry ‘Father’ or ‘Mother,’ the wealth of Damascus and the plunder of Samaria will be carried off by the king of Assyria.” 
\b
\m 
\v 5 And the LORD spoke to me further: 
\b
\q1 
\v 6 “Because this people has rejected 
\q2 the gently flowing waters of Shiloah 
\q1 and rejoiced in Rezin 
\q2 and the son of Remaliah, 
\q1 
\v 7 the Lord will surely bring against them 
\q2 the mighty floodwaters of the Euphrates \f + \fr 8:7 \ft Hebrew the River\f*—
\q2 the king of Assyria and all his pomp. 
\b
\q1 It will overflow its channels 
\q2 and overrun its banks. 
\q1 
\v 8 It will pour into Judah, 
\q2 swirling and sweeping over it, 
\q2 reaching up to the neck; 
\q1 its spreading streams will cover 
\q2 your entire land, O Immanuel!\f + \fr 8:8 \ft Immanuel means God with us.\f* 
\b
\q1 
\v 9 Huddle together,\f + \fr 8:9 \ft Or Raise the war cry or Be evil or Be broken\f* O peoples, and be shattered; 
\q2 pay attention, all you distant lands; 
\q1 prepare for battle, and be shattered; 
\q2 prepare for battle, and be shattered! 
\q1 
\v 10 Devise a plan, but it will be thwarted; 
\q2 state a proposal, but it will not happen. 
\q2 For God is with us.\f + \fr 8:10 \ft Hebrew Immanuel; see Matthew 1:23.\f*” 
\s1 A Call to Fear God
\r (Ecclesiastes 8:10–13)
\b
\m 
\v 11 For this is what the LORD has spoken to me with a strong hand, instructing me not to walk in the way of this people: 
\b
\q1 
\v 12 “Do not call conspiracy 
\q2 everything these people regard as conspiracy. 
\q1 Do not fear what they fear;\f + \fr 8:12 \ft Or Do not fear their threats\f* 
\q2 do not live in dread.\f + \fr 8:12 \ft LXX do not be shaken; cited in 1 Peter 3:14\f* 
\q1 
\v 13 The LORD of Hosts is the One 
\q2 you shall regard as holy. 
\q1 Only He should be feared; 
\q2 only He should be dreaded. 
\q2 
\v 14 And He will be a sanctuary—
\q1 but to both houses of Israel 
\q2 a stone of stumbling and a rock of offense,\f + \fr 8:14 \ft Cited in Romans 9:33 and 1 Peter 2:8\f* 
\q1 to the dwellers of Jerusalem 
\q2 a trap and a snare. 
\q1 
\v 15 Many will stumble over these; 
\q2 they will fall and be broken; 
\q2 they will be ensnared and captured.” 
\b
\q1 
\v 16 Bind up the testimony 
\q2 and seal the law among my disciples. 
\q1 
\v 17 I will wait for the LORD, 
\q2 who is hiding His face from the house of Jacob. 
\q2 I will put my trust in Him.\f + \fr 8:17 \ft Or I will eagerly look for Him; cited in Hebrews 2:13\f* 
\b
\m 
\v 18 Here am I, and the children the LORD has given me \f + \fr 8:18 \ft Cited in Hebrews 2:13\f* as signs and symbols in Israel from the LORD of Hosts, who dwells on Mount Zion. 
\s1 Darkness and Light
\b
\m 
\v 19 When men tell you to consult the spirits of the dead and the spiritists who whisper and mutter, shouldn’t a people consult their God instead? Why consult the dead on behalf of the living? 
\v 20 To the law and to the testimony! If they do not speak according to this word, they have no light of dawn. 
\b
\m 
\v 21 They will roam the land, dejected and hungry. When they are famished, they will become enraged; and looking upward, they will curse their king and their God. 
\v 22 Then they will look to the earth and see only distress and darkness and the gloom of anguish. And they will be driven into utter darkness. 
\c 9
\s1 Unto Us a Child Is Born
\r (Matthew 4:12–17; Mark 1:14–15; Luke 4:14–15)
\b
\m 
\v 1 Nevertheless, there will be no more gloom for those in distress. In the past He humbled the land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali, but in the future He will honor the Way of the Sea, beyond the Jordan, Galilee of the nations: 
\b
\q1 
\v 2 The people walking in darkness 
\q2 have seen a great light; 
\q1 on those living in the land of the shadow of death, 
\q2 a light has dawned.\f + \fr 9:2 \ft Cited in Matthew 4:15–16\f* 
\q1 
\v 3 You have enlarged the nation 
\q2 and increased its joy. 
\q1 The people rejoice before You 
\q2 as they rejoice at harvest time, 
\q2 as men rejoice in dividing the plunder. 
\b
\q1 
\v 4 For as in the day of Midian 
\q2 You have shattered the yoke of their burden, 
\q1 the bar across their shoulders, 
\q2 and the rod of their oppressor. 
\q1 
\v 5 For every trampling boot of battle 
\q2 and every garment rolled in blood 
\q2 will be burned as fuel for the fire. 
\b
\q1 
\v 6 For unto us a child is born, 
\q2 unto us a son is given, 
\q2 and the government will be upon His shoulders. 
\q1 And He will be called 
\q2 Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, 
\q2 Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace. 
\q1 
\v 7 Of the increase of His government and peace 
\q2 there will be no end. 
\q1 He will reign on the throne of David 
\q2 and over his kingdom, 
\q1 to establish and sustain it 
\q2 with justice and righteousness 
\q2 from that time and forevermore. 
\b
\q1 The zeal of the LORD of Hosts will accomplish this. 
\s1 Judgment against Israel’s Pride
\b
\q1 
\v 8 The Lord has sent a message against Jacob, 
\q2 and it has fallen upon Israel. 
\q1 
\v 9 All the people will know it—
\q2 Ephraim \f + \fr 9:9 \ft That is, the northern kingdom of Israel\f* and the dwellers of Samaria. 
\q1 With pride and arrogance of heart 
\q2 they will say: 
\q1 
\v 10 “The bricks have fallen, 
\q2 but we will rebuild with finished stone; 
\q1 the sycamores have been felled, 
\q2 but we will replace them with cedars.” 
\b
\q1 
\v 11 The LORD has raised up the foes of Rezin against him 
\q2 and joined his enemies together. 
\q1 
\v 12 Aram \f + \fr 9:12 \ft That is, Syria\f* from the east and Philistia from the west 
\q2 have devoured Israel with open mouths. 
\b
\q1 Despite all this, His anger is not turned away; 
\q2 His hand is still upraised. 
\s1 Judgment against Israel’s Hypocrisy
\b
\q1 
\v 13 But the people did not return to Him who struck them; 
\q2 they did not seek the LORD of Hosts. 
\q1 
\v 14 So the LORD will cut off Israel’s head and tail, 
\q2 both palm branch and reed in a single day. 
\q1 
\v 15 The head is the elder and honorable man, 
\q2 and the tail is the prophet who teaches lies. 
\q1 
\v 16 For those who guide this people mislead them, 
\q2 and those they mislead are swallowed up. 
\b
\q1 
\v 17 Therefore the Lord takes no pleasure in their young men; 
\q2 He has no compassion on their fatherless and widows. 
\q1 For every one of them is godless and wicked, 
\q2 and every mouth speaks folly. 
\b
\q1 Despite all this, His anger is not turned away; 
\q2 His hand is still upraised. 
\s1 Judgment against Israel’s Unrepentance
\b
\q1 
\v 18 For wickedness burns like a fire 
\q2 that consumes the thorns and briers 
\q1 and kindles the forest thickets 
\q2 which roll upward in billows of smoke. 
\q1 
\v 19 By the wrath of the LORD of Hosts 
\q2 the land is scorched, 
\q1 and the people are fuel for the fire. 
\q2 No man even spares his brother. 
\b
\q1 
\v 20 They carve out what is on the right, 
\q2 but they are still hungry; 
\q1 they eat what is on the left, 
\q2 but they are still not satisfied. 
\q2 Each one devours the flesh of his own offspring.\f + \fr 9:20 \ft Literally of his own arm\f* 
\q1 
\v 21 Manasseh devours Ephraim, 
\q2 and Ephraim Manasseh; 
\q2 together they turn against Judah. 
\b
\q1 Despite all this, His anger is not turned away; 
\q2 His hand is still upraised. 
\c 10
\s1 Woe to Tyrants
\b
\q1 
\v 1 Woe to those who enact unjust statutes 
\q2 and issue oppressive decrees, 
\q1 
\v 2 to deprive the poor of fair treatment 
\q2 and withhold justice from the oppressed of My people, 
\q1 to make widows their prey 
\q2 and orphans their plunder. 
\b
\q1 
\v 3 What will you do on the day of reckoning 
\q2 when devastation comes from afar? 
\q1 To whom will you flee for help? 
\q2 Where will you leave your wealth? 
\q1 
\v 4 Nothing will remain but to crouch among the captives 
\q2 or fall among the slain. 
\b
\q1 Despite all this, His anger is not turned away; 
\q2 His hand is still upraised. 
\s1 Judgment on Assyria
\b
\q1 
\v 5 Woe to Assyria, the rod of My anger; 
\q2 the staff in their hands is My wrath. 
\q1 
\v 6 I will send him against a godless nation; 
\q2 I will dispatch him against a people destined for My rage, 
\q1 to take spoils and seize plunder, 
\q2 and to trample them down like clay in the streets. 
\b
\q1 
\v 7 But this is not his intention; 
\q2 this is not his plan. 
\q1 For it is in his heart to destroy 
\q2 and cut off many nations. 
\q1 
\v 8 “Are not all my commanders kings?” he says. 
\q2 
\v 9 “Is not Calno like Carchemish? 
\q1 Is not Hamath like Arpad? 
\q2 Is not Samaria like Damascus? 
\q1 
\v 10 As my hand seized the idolatrous kingdoms 
\q2 whose images surpassed those of Jerusalem and Samaria, 
\q1 
\v 11 and as I have done to Samaria and its idols, 
\q2 will I not also do to Jerusalem and her idols?” 
\b
\m 
\v 12 So when the Lord has completed all His work against Mount Zion and Jerusalem, He will say, “I will punish the king of Assyria for the fruit of his arrogant heart and the proud look in his eyes. 
\v 13 For he says: 
\b
\q1 ‘By the strength of my hand I have done this, 
\q2 and by my wisdom, for I am clever. 
\q1 I have removed the boundaries of nations 
\q2 and plundered their treasures; 
\q2 like a mighty one I subdued their rulers. 
\q1 
\v 14 My hand reached as into a nest 
\q2 to seize the wealth of the nations. 
\q1 Like one gathering abandoned eggs, 
\q2 I gathered all the earth. 
\q1 No wing fluttered, 
\q2 no beak opened or chirped.’” 
\b
\q1 
\v 15 Does an axe raise itself above the one who swings it? 
\q2 Does a saw boast over him who saws with it? 
\q1 It would be like a rod waving the one who lifts it, 
\q2 or a staff lifting him who is not wood! 
\b
\q1 
\v 16 Therefore the Lord GOD of Hosts will send a wasting disease 
\q2 among Assyria’s stout warriors, 
\q1 and under his pomp will be kindled 
\q2 a fire like a burning flame. 
\q1 
\v 17 And the Light of Israel will become a fire, 
\q2 and its Holy One a flame. 
\q1 In a single day it will burn and devour 
\q2 Assyria’s thorns and thistles. 
\q1 
\v 18 The splendor of its forests and orchards, 
\q2 both soul and body, 
\q1 it will completely destroy, 
\q2 as a sickness consumes a man. 
\q1 
\v 19 The remaining trees of its forests will be so few 
\q2 that a child could count them. 
\s1 A Remnant Shall Return
\b
\q1 
\v 20 On that day the remnant of Israel 
\q2 and the survivors of the house of Jacob 
\q1 will no longer depend 
\q2 on him who struck them, 
\q1 but they will truly rely on the LORD, 
\q2 the Holy One of Israel. 
\b
\q1 
\v 21 A remnant will return \f + \fr 10:21 \ft Hebrew Shear-jashub; also in verse 22; see Isaiah 7:3.\f*—a remnant of Jacob—
\q2 to the Mighty God. 
\q1 
\v 22 Though your people, O Israel, be like the sand of the sea, 
\q2 only a remnant will return.\f + \fr 10:22 \ft LXX Though the people of Israel be like the sand of the sea, only a remnant will be saved. Cited in Romans 9:27\f* 
\q1 Destruction has been decreed, 
\q2 overflowing with righteousness. 
\q1 
\v 23 For the Lord GOD of Hosts will carry out 
\q2 the destruction decreed upon the whole land.\f + \fr 10:23 \ft LXX He will finish the work and cut it short in righteousness, because the Lord will make a short work in all the world. Cited in Romans 9:28\f* 
\b
\m 
\v 24 Therefore this is what the Lord GOD of Hosts says: 
\b
\q1 “O My people who dwell in Zion, 
\q2 do not fear Assyria, 
\q1 who strikes you with a rod 
\q2 and lifts his staff against you 
\q2 as the Egyptians did. 
\q1 
\v 25 For in just a little while 
\q2 My fury against you will subside, 
\q2 and My anger will turn to their destruction.” 
\b
\q1 
\v 26 And the LORD of Hosts will brandish a whip against them, 
\q2 as when He struck Midian at the rock of Oreb. 
\q1 He will raise His staff over the sea, 
\q2 as He did in Egypt. 
\q1 
\v 27 On that day the burden will be lifted from your shoulders, 
\q2 and the yoke from your neck. 
\q1 The yoke will be broken 
\q2 because your neck will be too large.\f + \fr 10:27 \ft Literally broken because of fatness; LXX broken from your shoulders\f* 
\b
\q1 
\v 28 Assyria has entered Aiath 
\q2 and passed through Migron, 
\q2 storing their supplies at Michmash. 
\q1 
\v 29 They have crossed at the ford: 
\q2 “We will spend the night at Geba.” 
\q1 Ramah trembles; 
\q2 Gibeah of Saul flees. 
\q1 
\v 30 Cry aloud, O Daughter of Gallim! 
\q2 Listen, O Laishah! 
\q2 O wretched Anathoth! 
\q1 
\v 31 Madmenah flees; 
\q2 the people of Gebim take refuge. 
\q1 
\v 32 Yet today they will halt at Nob, 
\q2 shaking a fist at the mount of Daughter Zion, 
\q2 at the hill of Jerusalem. 
\b
\q1 
\v 33 Behold, the Lord GOD of Hosts 
\q2 will lop off the branches with terrifying power. 
\q1 The tall trees will be cut down, 
\q2 the lofty ones will be felled. 
\q1 
\v 34 He will clear the forest thickets with an axe, 
\q2 and Lebanon will fall before the Mighty One.

\q2 the Spirit of counsel and strength, 
\q2 the Spirit of knowledge and fear of the LORD. 
\q1 
\v 3 And He will delight in the fear of the LORD. 
\b
\q1 He will not judge by what His eyes see, 
\q2 and He will not decide by what His ears hear, 
\q1 
\v 4 but with righteousness He will judge the poor, 
\q2 and with equity He will decide for the lowly of the earth. 
\q1 He will strike the earth with the rod of His mouth 
\q2 and slay the wicked with the breath of His lips. 
\q1 
\v 5 Righteousness will be the belt around His hips, 
\q2 and faithfulness the sash around His waist.

\q2 and the toddler will reach into the viper’s nest. 
\q1 
\v 9 They will neither harm nor destroy

\q1 
\v 12 He will raise a banner for the nations 
\q2 and gather the exiles of Israel;

\q2 from the four corners of the earth. 
\q1 
\v 13 Then the jealousy of Ephraim \f + \fr 11:13 \ft That is, the northern kingdom of Israel\f* will depart,

\q1 He will split it into seven streams 
\q2 for men to cross with dry sandals. 
\q1

\s1 The Burden against Babylon
\b
\m 
\v 1 This is the burden against Babylon that Isaiah son of Amoz received: 
\b
\q1 
\v 2 Raise a banner on a barren hilltop; 
\q2 call aloud to them. 
\q1 Wave your hand, 
\q2 that they may enter the gates of the nobles. 
\q1 
\v 3 I have commanded My sanctified ones; 
\q2 I have even summoned My warriors 
\q1 to execute My wrath 
\q2 and exult in My triumph. 
\q1 
\v 4 Listen, a tumult on the mountains, 
\q2 like that of a great multitude! 
\q1 Listen, an uproar among the kingdoms, 
\q2 like nations gathered together! 
\q1 The LORD of Hosts is mobilizing 
\q2 an army for war. 
\q1 
\v 5 They are coming from faraway lands, 
\q2 from the ends of the heavens—
\q1 the LORD and the weapons of His wrath—
\q2 to destroy the whole country. 
\b
\q1 
\v 6 Wail, for the Day of the LORD is near; 
\q2 it will come as destruction from the Almighty.\f + \fr 13:6 \ft Hebrew Shaddai\f* 
\q1 
\v 7 Therefore all hands will fall limp, 
\q2 and every man’s heart will melt. 
\q1 
\v 8 Terror, pain, and anguish will seize them; 
\q2 they will writhe like a woman in labor. 
\q1 They will look at one another, 
\q2 their faces flushed with fear. 
\b
\q1 
\v 9 Behold, the Day of the LORD is coming—
\q2 cruel, with fury and burning anger—
\q1 to make the earth a desolation 
\q2 and to destroy the sinners within it. 
\q1 
\v 10 For the stars of heaven and their constellations 
\q2 will not give their light. 
\q1 The rising sun will be darkened, 
\q2 and the moon will not give its light. 
\q1 
\v 11 I will punish the world for its evil 
\q2 and the wicked for their iniquity. 
\q1 I will end the haughtiness of the arrogant 
\q2 and lay low the pride of the ruthless. 
\q1 
\v 12 I will make man scarcer than pure gold, 
\q2 and mankind rarer than the gold of Ophir. 
\b
\q1 
\v 13 Therefore I will make the heavens tremble, 
\q2 and the earth will be shaken from its place 
\q1 at the wrath of the LORD of Hosts 
\q2 on the day of His burning anger. 
\q1 
\v 14 Like a hunted gazelle, 
\q2 like a sheep without a shepherd, 
\q1 each will return to his own people, 
\q2 each will flee to his native land. 
\q1 
\v 15 Whoever is caught will be stabbed, 
\q2 and whoever is captured will die by the sword. 
\b
\q1 
\v 16 Their infants will be dashed to pieces 
\q2 before their eyes, 
\q1 their houses will be looted, 
\q2 and their wives will be ravished. 
\q1 
\v 17 Behold, I will stir up against them the Medes, 
\q2 who have no regard for silver 
\q2 and no desire for gold. 
\q1 
\v 18 Their bows will dash young men to pieces; 
\q2 they will have no mercy on the fruit of the womb; 
\q2 they will not look with pity on the children. 
\q1 
\v 19 And Babylon, the jewel of the kingdoms, 
\q2 the glory of the pride of the Chaldeans, 
\q1 will be overthrown by God 
\q2 like Sodom and Gomorrah. 
\b
\q1 
\v 20 She will never be inhabited 
\q2 or settled from generation to generation; 
\q1 no nomad will pitch his tent there, 
\q2 no shepherd will rest his flock there. 
\q1 
\v 21 But desert creatures will lie down there, 
\q2 and howling creatures will fill her houses. 
\q1 Ostriches \f + \fr 13:21 \ft Literally Daughters of an ostrich or Daughters of an owl\f* will dwell there, 
\q2 and wild goats will leap about. 
\q1 
\v 22 Hyenas will howl in her fortresses 
\q2 and jackals \f + \fr 13:22 \ft Or serpents or dragons\f* in her luxurious palaces. 
\q1 Babylon’s time is at hand, 
\q2 and her days will not be prolonged. 
\c 14
\s1 Restoration for Israel
\b
\m 
\v 1 For the LORD will have compassion on Jacob; once again He will choose Israel and settle them in their own land. The foreigner will join them and unite with the house of Jacob. 
\v 2 The nations will escort Israel and bring it to its homeland. 
\b
\m Then the house of Israel will possess the nations as menservants and maidservants in the LORD’s land. They will make captives of their captors and rule over their oppressors. 
\s1 The Fall of the King of Babylon
\b
\m 
\v 3 On the day that the LORD gives you rest from your pain and torment, and from the hard labor into which you were forced, 
\v 4 you will sing this song of contempt against the king of Babylon: 
\b
\q1 How the oppressor has ceased, 
\q2 and how his fury \f + \fr 14:4 \ft DSS, LXX, and Syriac; MT the golden city\f* has ended! 
\q1 
\v 5 The LORD has broken the staff of the wicked, 
\q2 the scepter of the rulers. 
\q1 
\v 6 It struck the peoples in anger 
\q2 with unceasing blows; 
\q1 it subdued the nations in rage 
\q2 with relentless persecution. 
\q1 
\v 7 All the earth is at peace and at rest; 
\q2 they break out in song. 
\q1 
\v 8 Even the cypresses \f + \fr 14:8 \ft Or pines or junipers or firs\f* and cedars of Lebanon 
\q2 exult over you: 
\q1 “Since you have been laid low, 
\q2 no woodcutter comes against us.” 
\b
\q1 
\v 9 Sheol beneath is eager 
\q2 to meet you upon your arrival. 
\q1 It stirs the spirits of the dead to greet you—
\q2 all the rulers of the earth. 
\q1 It makes all the kings of the nations 
\q2 rise from their thrones. 
\q1 
\v 10 They will all respond to you, saying, 
\q2 “You too have become weak, as we are; 
\q2 you have become like us!” 
\q1 
\v 11 Your pomp has been brought down to Sheol, 
\q2 along with the music of your harps. 
\q1 Maggots are your bed 
\q2 and worms your blanket. 
\b
\q1 
\v 12 How you have fallen from heaven, 
\q2 O day star,\f + \fr 14:12 \ft Or morning star or shining one or Lucifer\f* son of the dawn! 
\q1 You have been cut down to the ground, 
\q2 O destroyer of nations. 
\q1 
\v 13 You said in your heart: 
\q2 “I will ascend to the heavens; 
\q1 I will raise my throne 
\q2 above the stars of God. 
\q1 I will sit on the mount of assembly, 
\q2 in the far reaches of the north.\f + \fr 14:13 \ft Or in the remote parts of Zaphon or on the heights of Zaphon\f* 
\q1 
\v 14 I will ascend above the tops of the clouds; 
\q2 I will make myself like the Most High.” 
\b
\q1 
\v 15 But you will be brought down to Sheol, 
\q2 to the lowest depths of the Pit. 
\q1 
\v 16 Those who see you will stare; 
\q2 they will ponder your fate: 
\q1 “Is this the man who shook the earth 
\q2 and made the kingdoms tremble, 
\q1 
\v 17 who turned the world into a desert 
\q2 and destroyed its cities, 
\q1 who refused to let the captives 
\q2 return to their homes?” 
\b
\q1 
\v 18 All the kings of the nations lie in state, 
\q2 each in his own tomb.\f + \fr 14:18 \ft Hebrew house\f* 
\q1 
\v 19 But you are cast out of your grave like a rejected branch, 
\q2 covered by those slain with the sword, 
\q1 and dumped into a rocky pit 
\q2 like a carcass trampled underfoot. 
\q1 
\v 20 You will not join them in burial, 
\q2 since you have destroyed your land 
\q2 and slaughtered your own people. 
\q1 The offspring of the wicked 
\q2 will never again be mentioned. 
\b
\q1 
\v 21 Prepare a place to slaughter his sons 
\q2 for the iniquities of their forefathers. 
\q1 They will never rise up to possess a land 
\q2 or cover the earth with their cities. 
\q1 
\v 22 “I will rise up against them,” 
\q2 declares the LORD of Hosts. 
\q1 “I will cut off from Babylon 
\q2 her name and her remnant, 
\q2 her offspring and her posterity,” 
\qr declares the LORD. 
\q1 
\v 23 “I will make her a place 
\q2 for owls and for swamplands; 
\q1 I will sweep her away 
\q2 with the broom of destruction,” 
\q2 declares the LORD of Hosts. 
\s1 God’s Purpose against Assyria
\b
\m 
\v 24 The LORD of Hosts has sworn: 
\b
\q1 “Surely, as I have planned, so will it be; 
\q2 as I have purposed, so will it stand. 
\q1 
\v 25 I will break Assyria in My land; 
\q2 I will trample him on My mountain. 
\q1 His yoke will be taken off My people, 
\q2 and his burden removed from their shoulders.” 
\b
\q1 
\v 26 This is the plan devised for the whole earth, 
\q2 and this is the hand stretched out over all the nations. 
\q1 
\v 27 The LORD of Hosts has purposed, 
\q2 and who can thwart Him? 
\q1 His hand is outstretched, 
\q2 so who can turn it back? 
\s1 Philistia Will Be Destroyed
\b
\m 
\v 28 In the year that King Ahaz died, this burden was received: 
\b
\q1 
\v 29 Do not rejoice, all you Philistines, 
\q2 that the rod that struck you is broken. 
\q1 For a viper will spring from the root of the snake, 
\q2 and a flying serpent from its egg. 
\q1 
\v 30 Then the firstborn of the poor will find pasture, 
\q2 and the needy will lie down in safety, 
\q1 but I will kill your root by famine, 
\q2 and your remnant will be slain. 
\b
\q1 
\v 31 Wail, O gate! Cry out, O city! 
\q2 Melt away, all you Philistines! 
\q1 For a cloud of smoke comes from the north, 
\q2 and there are no stragglers in its ranks. 
\q1 
\v 32 What answer will be given 
\q2 to the envoys of that nation? 
\q1 “The LORD has founded Zion, 
\q2 where His afflicted people will find refuge.”

\s1 The Burden against Moab
\r (Jeremiah 48:1–47)
\b
\m 
\v 1 This is the burden against Moab: 
\b
\q1 Ar in Moab is ruined, 
\q2 destroyed in a night! 
\q1 Kir in Moab is devastated, 
\q2 destroyed in a night! 
\q1 
\v 2 Dibon goes up to its temple 
\q2 to weep at its high places. 
\q1 Moab wails over Nebo, 
\q2 as well as over Medeba. 
\b
\q1 Every head is shaved, 
\q2 every beard is cut off. 
\q1 
\v 3 In its streets they wear sackcloth; 
\q2 on the rooftops and in the public squares 
\q2 they all wail, falling down weeping. 
\q1 
\v 4 Heshbon and Elealeh cry out; 
\q2 their voices are heard as far as Jahaz. 
\q1 Therefore the soldiers of Moab cry out; 
\q2 their souls tremble within. 
\b
\q1 
\v 5 My heart cries out over Moab; 
\q2 her fugitives flee as far as Zoar, 
\q2 as far as Eglath-shelishiyah.\f + \fr 15:5 \ft Or Zoar, like a heifer three years of age.\f* 
\q1 With weeping they ascend the slope of Luhith; 
\q2 they lament their destruction on the road to Horonaim. 
\q1 
\v 6 The waters of Nimrim are dried up, 
\q2 and the grass is withered; 
\q1 the vegetation is gone, 
\q2 and the greenery is no more. 
\q1 
\v 7 So they carry their wealth and belongings 
\q2 over the Brook of the Willows.\f + \fr 15:7 \ft Or Poplars\f* 
\b
\q1 
\v 8 For their outcry echoes to the border of Moab. 
\q2 Their wailing reaches Eglaim; 
\q2 it is heard in Beer-elim. 
\q1 
\v 9 The waters of Dimon \f + \fr 15:9 \ft MT, twice in this verse; DSS and Vulgate Dibon; Dimon, a wordplay on Dibon (see verse 2), sounds like the Hebrew for blood.\f* are full of blood, 
\q2 but I will bring more upon Dimon—
\q1 a lion upon the fugitives of Moab 
\q2 and upon the remnant of the land. 
\c 16
\s1 Moab’s Destruction
\r (Zephaniah 2:8–11)
\b
\q1 
\v 1 Send the tribute lambs 
\q2 to the ruler of the land, 
\q1 from Sela in the desert 
\q2 to the mount of Daughter Zion. 
\q1 
\v 2 Like fluttering birds 
\q2 pushed out of the nest, 
\q1 so are the daughters of Moab 
\q2 at the fords of the Arnon: 
\q1 
\v 3 “Give us counsel; 
\q2 render a decision. 
\q1 Shelter us at noonday 
\q2 with shade as dark as night. 
\q1 Hide the refugees; 
\q2 do not betray the one who flees. 
\q1 
\v 4 Let my fugitives stay with you; 
\q2 be a refuge for Moab from the destroyer.” 
\b
\q1 When the oppressor has gone, destruction has ceased, 
\q2 and the oppressors have vanished from the land, 
\q1 
\v 5 in loving devotion \f + \fr 16:5 \ft Forms of the Hebrew chesed are translated here and in most cases throughout the Scriptures as loving devotion; the range of meaning includes love, goodness, kindness, faithfulness, and mercy, as well as loyalty to a covenant.\f* a throne will be established 
\q2 in the tent of David. 
\q1 A judge seeking justice and hastening righteousness 
\q2 will sit on it in faithfulness. 
\b
\q1 
\v 6 We have heard of Moab’s pomposity, 
\q2 his exceeding pride and conceit, 
\q1 his overflowing arrogance. 
\q2 But his boasting is empty. 
\q1 
\v 7 Therefore let Moab wail; 
\q2 let them wail together for Moab. 
\q1 Moan for the raisin cakes of Kir-hareseth, 
\q2 you who are utterly stricken. 
\q1 
\v 8 For the fields of Heshbon have withered, 
\q2 along with the grapevines of Sibmah. 
\q1 The rulers of the nations 
\q2 have trampled its choicest vines, 
\q1 which had reached as far as Jazer 
\q2 and spread toward the desert. 
\q1 Their shoots had spread out 
\q2 and passed over the sea.\f + \fr 16:8 \ft Or and had gone as far as the sea; that is, probably the Dead Sea\f* 
\b
\q1 
\v 9 So I weep with Jazer 
\q2 for the vines of Sibmah; 
\q1 I drench Heshbon and Elealeh 
\q2 with my tears. 
\q1 Triumphant shouts have fallen silent 
\q2 over your summer fruit and your harvest. 
\q1 
\v 10 Joy and gladness are removed from the orchard; 
\q2 no one sings or shouts in the vineyards. 
\q1 No one tramples the grapes in the winepresses; 
\q2 I have put an end to the cheering. 
\q1 
\v 11 Therefore my heart laments for Moab like a harp, 
\q2 my inmost being for Kir-heres.\f + \fr 16:11 \ft Kir-heres is a variant of Kir-hareseth; see verse 7.\f* 
\q1 
\v 12 When Moab appears on the high place, 
\q2 when he wearies himself 
\q1 and enters his sanctuary to pray, 
\q2 it will do him no good. 
\b
\m 
\v 13 This is the message that the LORD spoke earlier concerning Moab. 
\v 14 And now the LORD says, “In three years, as a hired worker counts the years, Moab’s splendor will become an object of contempt, with all her many people. And those who are left will be few and feeble.”

\q2 they will be left to the flocks,

\q1 
\v 4 “In that day the splendor of Jacob will fade, 
\q2 and the fat of his body will waste away, 
\q1 
\v 5 as the reaper gathers the standing grain 
\q2 and harvests the ears with his arm, 
\q1 as one gleans heads of grain 
\q2 in the Valley of Rephaim. 
\q1 
\v 6 Yet gleanings will remain, 
\q2 like an olive tree that has been beaten—
\q1 two or three berries atop the tree, 
\q2 four or five on its fruitful branches,” 
\qr declares the LORD, the God of Israel. 
\q1 
\v 7 In that day men will look to their Maker 
\q2 and turn their eyes to the Holy One of Israel. 
\q1 
\v 8 They will not look to the altars 
\q2 they have fashioned with their hands 
\q1 or to the Asherahs and incense altars 
\q2 they have made with their fingers. 
\b
\q1 
\v 9 In that day their strong cities 
\q2 will be like forsaken thickets and summits, 
\q1 abandoned to the Israelites 
\q2 and to utter desolation.

\q1 
\v 10 For you have forgotten the God of your salvation

\v 11 though on the day you plant 
\q2 you make them grow,

\q2 brother will fight against brother, neighbor against neighbor, 
\q2 city against city, and kingdom against kingdom. 
\q1 
\v 3 Then the spirit of the Egyptians will be emptied out from among them, 
\q2 and I will frustrate their plans,

\q2 to mediums and spiritists. 
\q1 
\v 4 I will deliver the Egyptians into the hands of harsh masters, 
\q2 and a fierce king will rule over them,” 
\qr declares the Lord GOD of Hosts.

\v 5 The waters of the Nile will dry up, 
\q2 and the riverbed will be parched and empty.

\v 25 The LORD of Hosts will bless them, saying, “Blessed be Egypt My people, Assyria My handiwork, and Israel My inheritance.”

\s1 A Sign against Egypt and Cush
\b
\m 
\v 1 Before the year that the chief commander, sent by Sargon king of Assyria, came to Ashdod and attacked and captured it, 
\v 2 the LORD had already spoken through Isaiah son of Amoz, saying, “Go, remove the sackcloth from your waist and the sandals from your feet.” 
\b
\m And Isaiah did so, walking around naked and barefoot. 
\b
\m 
\v 3 Then the LORD said, “Just as My servant Isaiah has gone naked and barefoot for three years as a sign and omen against Egypt and Cush,\f + \fr 20:3 \ft That is, the upper Nile region; similarly in verses 4 and 5\f* 
\v 4 so the king of Assyria will lead away the captives of Egypt and the exiles of Cush, young and old alike, naked and barefoot, with bared buttocks—to Egypt’s shame. 
\b
\m 
\v 5 Those who made Cush their hope and Egypt their boast will be dismayed and ashamed. 
\v 6 And on that day the dwellers of this coastland will say, ‘See what has happened to our source of hope, those to whom we fled for help and deliverance from the king of Assyria! How then can we escape?’”

\s1 Babylon Is Fallen
\r (Revelation 18:1–8)
\b
\m 
\v 1 This is the burden against the Desert by the Sea: 
\b
\q1 Like whirlwinds sweeping through the Negev, 
\q2 an invader comes from the desert, 
\q2 from a land of terror. 
\q1 
\v 2 A dire vision is declared to me: 
\q2 “The traitor still betrays, 
\q2 and the destroyer still destroys. 
\q1 Go up, O Elam! Lay siege, O Media! 
\q2 I will put an end to all her groaning.” 
\b
\q1 
\v 3 Therefore my body is filled with anguish. 
\q2 Pain grips me, like the pains of a woman in labor. 
\q1 I am bewildered to hear, 
\q2 I am dismayed to see. 
\q1 
\v 4 My heart falters; 
\q2 fear makes me tremble. 
\q1 The twilight of my desire 
\q2 has turned to horror. 
\q1 
\v 5 They prepare a table, they lay out a carpet, 
\q2 they eat, they drink! 
\b
\q1 Rise up, O princes, oil the shields! 
\q2 
\v 6 For this is what the Lord says to me: 
\b
\q1 “Go, post a lookout 
\q2 and have him report what he sees. 
\q1 
\v 7 When he sees chariots with teams of horsemen, 
\q2 riders on donkeys, riders on camels, 
\q2 he must be alert, fully alert.” 
\b
\q1 
\v 8 Then the lookout \f + \fr 21:8 \ft DSS and Syriac; MT lion\f* shouted: 
\b
\q1 “Day after day, my lord, 
\q2 I stand on the watchtower; 
\q1 night after night 
\q2 I stay at my post. 
\q1 
\v 9 Look, here come the riders, 
\q2 horsemen in pairs.” 
\b
\q1 And one answered, saying: 
\b
\q1 “Fallen, fallen is Babylon!\f + \fr 21:9 \ft See Revelation 14:8 and Revelation 18:2.\f* 
\q2 All the images of her gods 
\q2 lie shattered on the ground!” 
\b
\q1 
\v 10 O my people, crushed on the threshing floor, 
\q2 I tell you what I have heard 
\q1 from the LORD of Hosts, 
\q2 the God of Israel. 
\s1 The Burden against Edom
\r (Isaiah 34:5–17)
\b
\m 
\v 11 This is the burden against Dumah:\f + \fr 21:11 \ft Dumah is a wordplay on Edom, meaning silence.\f* 
\b
\q1 One calls to me from Seir,\f + \fr 21:11 \ft Seir is another name for Edom.\f* 
\q2 “Watchman, what is left of the night? 
\q2 Watchman, what is left of the night?” 
\b
\q1 
\v 12 The watchman replies, 
\q2 “Morning has come, but also the night. 
\q1 If you would inquire, then inquire. 
\q2 Come back yet again.” 
\s1 The Burden against Arabia
\b
\m 
\v 13 This is the burden against Arabia: 
\b
\q1 In the thickets of Arabia you must lodge, 
\q2 O caravans of Dedanites. 
\q1 
\v 14 Bring water for the thirsty, 
\q2 O dwellers of Tema; 
\q2 meet the refugees with food. 
\q1 
\v 15 For they flee from the sword—
\q2 the sword that is drawn—
\q1 from the bow that is bent, 
\q2 and from the stress of battle. 
\b
\m 
\v 16 For this is what the Lord says to me: “Within one year, as a hired worker would count it, all the glory of Kedar will be gone. 
\v 17 The remaining archers, the warriors of Kedar, will be few.” 
\b
\m For the LORD, the God of Israel, has spoken. 
\c 22
\s1 The Valley of Vision
\b
\m 
\v 1 This is the burden against the Valley of Vision: 
\b
\q1 What ails you now, 
\q2 that you have all gone up to the rooftops, 
\q1 
\v 2 O city of commotion, 
\q2 O town of revelry? 
\b
\q1 Your slain did not die by the sword, 
\q2 nor were they killed in battle. 
\q1 
\v 3 All your rulers have fled together, 
\q2 captured without a bow. 
\q1 All your fugitives were captured together, 
\q2 having fled to a distant place. 
\q1 
\v 4 Therefore I said, 
\q2 “Turn away from me, let me weep bitterly! 
\q1 Do not try to console me 
\q2 over the destruction of the daughter of my people.” 
\b
\q1 
\v 5 For the Lord GOD of Hosts has set a day 
\q2 of tumult and trampling and confusion in the Valley of Vision—
\q1 of breaking down the walls 
\q2 and crying to the mountains. 
\q1 
\v 6 Elam takes up a quiver, with chariots and horsemen, 
\q2 and Kir uncovers the shield. 
\q1 
\v 7 Your choicest valleys are full of chariots, 
\q2 and horsemen are posted at the gates. 
\q1 
\v 8 He has uncovered 
\q2 the defenses of Judah. 
\b
\m On that day you looked to the weapons in the House of the Forest. 
\v 9 You saw that there were many breaches in the walls of the City of David. You collected water from the lower pool. 
\v 10 You counted the houses of Jerusalem and tore them down to strengthen the wall. 
\v 11 You built a reservoir between the walls for the waters of the ancient pool, but you did not look to the One who made it, or consider Him who planned it long ago. 
\b
\q1 
\v 12 On that day the Lord GOD of Hosts 
\q2 called for weeping and wailing, 
\q1 for shaven heads 
\q2 and the wearing of sackcloth. 
\q1 
\v 13 But look, there is joy and gladness, 
\q2 butchering of cattle and slaughtering of sheep, 
\q1 eating of meat and drinking of wine: 
\q2 “Let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we die!”\f + \fr 22:13 \ft Cited in 1 Corinthians 15:32\f* 
\b
\m 
\v 14 The LORD of Hosts has revealed in my hearing: 
\b
\q1 “Until your dying day, 
\q2 this sin of yours will never be atoned for,” 
\qr says the Lord GOD of Hosts. 
\s1 A Message for Shebna
\b
\m 
\v 15 This is what the Lord GOD of Hosts says: “Go, say to Shebna, the steward in charge of the palace: 
\v 16 What are you doing here, and who authorized you to carve out a tomb for yourself here—to chisel your tomb in the height and cut your resting place in the rock? 
\b
\m 
\v 17 Look, O mighty man! The LORD is about to shake you violently. He will take hold of you, 
\v 18 roll you into a ball, and sling you into a wide land. There you will die, and there your glorious chariots will remain—a disgrace to the house of your master. 
\v 19 I will remove you from office, and you will be ousted from your position. 
\b
\m 
\v 20 On that day I will summon My servant, Eliakim son of Hilkiah. 
\v 21 I will clothe him with your robe and tie your sash around him. I will put your authority in his hand, and he will be a father to the dwellers of Jerusalem and to the house of Judah. 
\v 22 I will place on his shoulder the key to the house of David. What he opens no one can shut, and what he shuts no one can open.\f + \fr 22:22 \ft See Revelation 3:7.\f* 
\v 23 I will drive him like a peg into a firm place, and he will be a throne of glory for the house of his father. 
\b
\m 
\v 24 So they will hang on him the whole burden of his father’s house: the descendants and the offshoots—all the lesser vessels, from bowls to every kind of jar. 
\b
\m 
\v 25 In that day, declares the LORD of Hosts, the peg driven into a firm place will give way; it will be sheared off and fall, and the load upon it will be cut down.” 
\b
\m Indeed, the LORD has spoken. 
\c 23
\s1 The Burden against Tyre
\r (Ezekiel 26:1–21)
\b
\m 
\v 1 This is the burden against Tyre: 
\b
\q1 Wail, O ships of Tarshish,\f + \fr 23:1 \ft Or Wail, O fleet of trading ships; also in verse 14\f* 
\q2 for Tyre is laid waste, 
\q2 without house or harbor. 
\q1 Word has reached them 
\q2 from the land of Cyprus.\f + \fr 23:1 \ft Hebrew Kittim; also in verse 12\f* 
\q1 
\v 2 Be silent, O dwellers of the coastland, 
\q2 you merchants of Sidon, 
\q2 whose traders have crossed the sea.\f + \fr 23:2 \ft DSS and LXX; MT whom the seafarers have enriched\f* 
\q1 
\v 3 On the great waters 
\q2 came the grain of Shihor; 
\q1 the harvest of the Nile was the revenue of Tyre; 
\q2 she was the merchant of the nations. 
\q1 
\v 4 Be ashamed, O Sidon, the stronghold of the sea, 
\q2 for the sea has spoken: 
\q1 “I have not been in labor 
\q2 or given birth. 
\q1 I have not raised young men 
\q2 or brought up young women.” 
\q1 
\v 5 When the report reaches Egypt, 
\q2 they will writhe in agony over the news of Tyre. 
\b
\q1 
\v 6 Cross over to Tarshish; 
\q2 wail, O inhabitants of the coastland! 
\q1 
\v 7 Is this your jubilant city, 
\q2 whose origin is from antiquity, 
\q1 whose feet have taken her 
\q2 to settle far away? 
\q1 
\v 8 Who planned this against Tyre, 
\q2 the bestower of crowns, 
\q1 whose traders are princes, 
\q2 whose merchants are renowned on the earth? 
\q1 
\v 9 The LORD of Hosts planned it, 
\q2 to defile all its glorious beauty, 
\q2 to disgrace all the renowned of the earth. 
\b
\q1 
\v 10 Cultivate \f + \fr 23:10 \ft DSS and some LXX manuscripts; MT Overflow\f* your land like the Nile, O Daughter of Tarshish; 
\q2 there is no longer a harbor. 
\q1 
\v 11 The LORD has stretched out His hand over the sea; 
\q2 He has made kingdoms tremble. 
\q1 He has given a command 
\q2 that the strongholds of Canaan be destroyed. 
\q1 
\v 12 He said, “You shall rejoice no more, 
\q2 O oppressed Virgin Daughter of Sidon. 
\q1 Get up and cross over to Cyprus—
\q2 even there you will find no rest.” 
\b
\q1 
\v 13 Look at the land of the Chaldeans \f + \fr 23:13 \ft That is, the Babylonians\f*—
\q2 a people now of no account. 
\q1 The Assyrians destined it for the desert creatures; 
\q2 they set up their siege towers and stripped its palaces. 
\q2 They brought it to ruin. 
\b
\q1 
\v 14 Wail, O ships of Tarshish, 
\q2 for your harbor has been destroyed! 
\b
\m 
\v 15 At that time Tyre will be forgotten for seventy years—the span of a king’s life. But at the end of seventy years, it will happen to Tyre as in the song of the harlot: 
\b
\q1 
\v 16 “Take up your harp, 
\q2 stroll through the city, 
\q2 O forgotten harlot. 
\q1 Make sweet melody, 
\q2 sing many a song, 
\q2 so you will be remembered.” 
\b
\m 
\v 17 And at the end of seventy years, the LORD will restore Tyre. Then she will return to hire as a prostitute and sell herself to all the kingdoms on the face of the earth. 
\v 18 Yet her profits and wages will be set apart to the LORD; they will not be stored or saved, for her profit will go to those who live before the LORD, for abundant food and fine clothing.

\s1 God’s Judgment on the Earth
\b
\q1 
\v 1 Behold, the LORD lays waste the earth 
\q2 and leaves it in ruins. 
\q1 He will twist its surface 
\q2 and scatter its inhabitants—
\q1 
\v 2 people and priest alike, servant and master, 
\q2 maid and mistress, buyer and seller, 
\q2 lender and borrower, creditor and debtor. 
\q1 
\v 3 The earth will be utterly laid waste 
\q2 and thoroughly plundered. 
\qr For the LORD has spoken this word. 
\q1 
\v 4 The earth mourns and withers; 
\q2 the world languishes and fades; 
\q2 the exalted of the earth waste away. 
\q1 
\v 5 The earth is defiled by its people; 
\q2 they have transgressed the laws; 
\q1 they have overstepped the decrees 
\q2 and broken the everlasting covenant. 
\q1 
\v 6 Therefore a curse has consumed the earth, 
\q2 and its inhabitants must bear the guilt; 
\q1 the earth’s dwellers have been burned, 
\q2 and only a few survive. 
\b
\q1 
\v 7 The new wine dries up, the vine withers. 
\q2 All the merrymakers now groan. 
\q1 
\v 8 The joyful tambourines have ceased; 
\q2 the noise of revelers has stopped; 
\q2 the joyful harp is silent. 
\q1 
\v 9 They no longer sing and drink wine; 
\q2 strong drink is bitter to those who consume it. 
\b
\q1 
\v 10 The city of chaos is shattered; 
\q2 every house is closed to entry. 
\q1 
\v 11 In the streets they cry out for wine. 
\q2 All joy turns to gloom; 
\q2 rejoicing is exiled from the land. 
\q1 
\v 12 The city is left in ruins; 
\q2 its gate is reduced to rubble. 
\q1 
\v 13 So will it be on the earth 
\q2 and among the nations, 
\q1 like a harvested olive tree, 
\q2 like a gleaning after a grape harvest. 
\b
\q1 
\v 14 They raise their voices, they shout for joy; 
\q2 from the west \f + \fr 24:14 \ft Or from the sea\f* they proclaim the majesty of the LORD. 
\q1 
\v 15 Therefore glorify the LORD in the east. 
\q2 Extol the name of the LORD, the God of Israel 
\q2 in the islands \f + \fr 24:15 \ft Or coastlands\f* of the sea. 
\q1 
\v 16 From the ends of the earth we hear singing: 
\q2 “Glory to the Righteous One.” 
\b
\q1 But I said, “I am wasting away! I am wasting away! 
\q2 Woe is me.” 
\q1 The treacherous betray; 
\q2 the treacherous deal in treachery. 
\q1 
\v 17 Terror and pit and snare await you, 
\q2 O dweller of the earth. 
\q1 
\v 18 Whoever flees the sound of panic 
\q2 will fall into the pit, 
\q1 and whoever climbs from the pit 
\q2 will be caught in the snare. 
\b
\q1 For the windows of heaven are open, 
\q2 and the foundations of the earth are shaken. 
\q1 
\v 19 The earth is utterly broken apart, 
\q2 the earth is split open, 
\q2 the earth is shaken violently. 
\q1 
\v 20 The earth staggers like a drunkard 
\q2 and sways like a shack. 
\q1 Earth’s rebellion weighs it down, 
\q2 and it falls, never to rise again. 
\b
\q1 
\v 21 In that day the LORD will punish 
\q2 the host of heaven above 
\q2 and the kings of the earth below. 
\q1 
\v 22 They will be gathered together 
\q2 like prisoners in a pit. 
\q1 They will be confined to a dungeon 
\q2 and punished after many days. 
\q1 
\v 23 The moon will be confounded 
\q2 and the sun will be ashamed; 
\q1 for the LORD of Hosts will reign 
\q2 on Mount Zion and in Jerusalem, 
\q2 and before His elders with great glory.

\s1 Praise to the Victorious God
\r (Jeremiah 51:15–19)
\b
\q1 
\v 1 O LORD, You are my God! 
\b
\q1 I will exalt You; 
\q2 I will praise Your name. 
\q1 For You have worked wonders—
\q2 plans formed long ago—
\q2 in perfect faithfulness. 
\q1 
\v 2 Indeed, You have made the city a heap of rubble, 
\q2 the fortified town a ruin. 
\q1 The fortress of strangers is a city no more; 
\q2 it will never be rebuilt. 
\q1 
\v 3 Therefore, a strong people will honor You. 
\q2 The cities of ruthless nations will revere You. 
\b
\q1 
\v 4 For You have been a refuge for the poor, 
\q2 a stronghold for the needy in distress, 
\q1 a refuge from the storm, 
\q2 a shade from the heat. 
\q1 For the breath of the ruthless 
\q2 is like rain against a wall, 
\q1 
\v 5 like heat in a dry land. 
\q2 You subdue the uproar of foreigners. 
\q1 As the shade of a cloud cools the heat, 
\q2 so the song of the ruthless is silenced. 
\b
\q1 
\v 6 On this mountain the LORD of Hosts 
\q2 will prepare a banquet for all the peoples, 
\q1 a feast of aged wine, of choice meat, 
\q2 of finely aged wine. 
\q1 
\v 7 On this mountain He will swallow up 
\q2 the shroud that enfolds all peoples, 
\q2 the sheet that covers all nations; 
\q1 
\v 8 He will swallow up death forever.\f + \fr 25:8 \ft Or He will swallow up death in victory; cited in 1 Corinthians 15:54\f* 
\q2 The Lord GOD will wipe away the tears from every face \f + \fr 25:8 \ft Cited in Revelation 7:17 and Revelation 21:4\f* 
\q1 and remove the disgrace of His people

\q2 we have waited for Him, and He has saved us. 
\q1 This is the LORD for whom we have waited. 
\q2 Let us rejoice and be glad in His salvation.” 
\b
\q1 
\v 10 For the hand of the LORD 
\q2 will rest on this mountain. 
\q1 But Moab will be trampled in his place 
\q2 as straw is trodden into the dung pile. 
\q1 
\v 11 He will spread out his hands within it,

\s1 A Song of Salvation

\q1 We have a strong city; 
\q2 salvation is established as its walls and ramparts. 
\q1 
\v 2 Open the gates so a righteous nation may enter—
\q2 one that remains faithful. 
\q1 
\v 3 You will keep in perfect peace the steadfast of mind, 
\q2 because he trusts in You. 
\q1 
\v 4 Trust in the LORD forever, 
\q2 because GOD the LORD is the Rock eternal. 
\q1 
\v 5 For He has humbled those who dwell on high; 
\q2 He lays the lofty city low. 
\q1 He brings it down to the ground; 
\q2 He casts it into the dust. 
\q1 
\v 6 Feet trample it down—
\q2 the feet of the oppressed, 
\q2 the steps of the poor. 
\b
\q1 
\v 7 The path of the righteous is level; 
\q2 You clear a straight path for the upright. 
\q1 
\v 8 Yes, we wait for You, O LORD; 
\q2 we walk in the path of Your judgments. 
\q1 Your name and renown 
\q2 are the desire of our souls. 
\q1 
\v 9 My soul longs for You in the night; 
\q2 indeed, my spirit seeks You at dawn.\f + \fr 26:9 \ft Or my spirit within me seeks You.\f* 
\q1 For when Your judgments come upon the earth,

\q1 
\v 10 Though grace is shown to the wicked man, 
\q2 he does not learn righteousness. 
\q1 In the land of righteousness he acts unjustly 
\q2 and fails to see the majesty of the LORD. 
\b
\q1 
\v 11 O LORD, Your hand is upraised, 
\q2 but they do not see it. 
\q1 They will see Your zeal for Your people 
\q2 and be put to shame. 
\q1 The fire set for Your enemies 
\q2 will consume them! 
\q1 
\v 12 O LORD, You will establish peace for us. 
\q2 For all that we have accomplished, 
\q2 You have done for us. 
\q1 
\v 13 O LORD our God, other lords besides You have had dominion, 
\q2 but Your name alone do we confess. 
\b
\q1 
\v 14 The dead will not live; 
\q2 the departed spirits will not rise. 
\q1 Therefore You have punished and destroyed them; 
\q2 You have wiped out all memory of them. 
\q1 
\v 15 You have enlarged the nation, O LORD; 
\q2 You have enlarged the nation. 
\q1 You have gained glory for Yourself; 
\q2 You have extended all the borders of the land. 
\b
\q1 
\v 16 O LORD, they sought You in their distress; 
\q2 when You disciplined them, they poured out a quiet prayer. 
\q1 
\v 17 As a woman with child about to give birth 
\q2 writhes and cries out in pain, 
\q2 so were we in Your presence, O LORD. 
\q1 
\v 18 We were with child; we writhed in pain; 
\q2 but we gave birth to wind. 
\q1 We have given no salvation to the earth, 
\q2 nor brought any life into the world. 
\b
\q1 
\v 19 Your dead will live; their bodies will rise. 
\q2 Awake and sing, you who dwell in the dust! 
\q1 For your dew is like the dew of the morning, 
\q2 and the earth will bring forth her dead. 
\b
\q1 
\v 20 Go, my people, enter your rooms 
\q2 and shut your doors behind you. 
\q1 Hide yourselves a little while 
\q2 until the wrath has passed. 
\q1 
\v 21 For behold, the LORD is coming out of His dwelling 
\q2 to punish the inhabitants of the earth for their iniquity.

\q1 There the calves graze, and there they lie down; 
\q2 they strip its branches bare. 
\q1 
\v 11 When its limbs are dry, 
\q2 they are broken off. 
\q1 Women come and use them for kindling; 
\q2 for this is a people without understanding. 
\q1 Therefore their Maker has no compassion on them, 
\q2 and their Creator shows them no favor. 
\b
\m 
\v 12 In that day the LORD will thresh from the flowing Euphrates \f + \fr 27:12 \ft Hebrew River\f* to the Wadi of Egypt, and you, O Israelites, will be gathered one by one. 
\v 13 And in that day a great ram’s horn will sound, and those who were perishing in Assyria will come forth with those who were exiles in Egypt. And they will worship the LORD on the holy mountain in Jerusalem.

\s1 The Captivity of Ephraim
\b
\q1 
\v 1 Woe to the majestic crown of Ephraim’s \f + \fr 28:1 \ft That is, the northern kingdom of Israel; also in verse 3\f* drunkards, 
\q2 to the fading flower of his glorious splendor, 
\q1 set on the summit above the fertile valley, 
\q2 the pride of those overcome by wine. 
\q1 
\v 2 Behold, the Lord has one 
\q2 who is strong and mighty. 
\q1 Like a hailstorm or destructive tempest, 
\q2 like a driving rain or flooding downpour, 
\q2 he will smash that crown to the ground. 
\q1 
\v 3 The majestic crown of Ephraim’s drunkards 
\q2 will be trampled underfoot. 
\q1 
\v 4 The fading flower of his beautiful splendor, 
\q2 set on the summit above the fertile valley, 
\q1 will be like a ripe fig before the summer harvest: 
\q2 Whoever sees it will take it in his hand and swallow it. 
\b
\q1 
\v 5 On that day the LORD of Hosts will be a crown of glory, 
\q2 a diadem of splendor to the remnant of His people, 
\q1 
\v 6 a spirit of justice to him who sits in judgment, 
\q2 and a strength to those who repel the onslaught at the gate. 
\b
\q1 
\v 7 These also stagger from wine 
\q2 and stumble from strong drink: 
\q1 Priests and prophets reel from strong drink 
\q2 and are befuddled by wine. 
\q1 They stumble because of strong drink, 
\q2 muddled in their visions and stumbling in their judgments. 
\q1 
\v 8 For all their tables are covered with vomit; 
\q2 there is not a place without filth. 
\b
\q1 
\v 9 Whom is He trying to teach? 
\q2 To whom is He explaining His message? 
\q1 To infants just weaned from milk? 
\q2 To babies removed from the breast? 
\q1 
\v 10 For they hear:\f + \fr 28:10 \ft Or For He says; or For it is; literally For\f* 
\q2 “Order on order, order on order, 
\q2 line on line, line on line;\f + \fr 28:10 \ft Or Do this, do that, a rule for this, a rule for that; Hebrew sav lasav sav lasav kav lakav kav lakav (possibly meaningless sounds to demonstrate an inability to understand); also in verse 13\f* 
\q2 a little here, a little there.” 
\q1 
\v 11 Indeed, with mocking lips and foreign tongues, 
\q2 He will speak to this people \f + \fr 28:11 \ft Cited in 1 Corinthians 14:21\f* 
\v 12 to whom He has said: 
\q1 “This is the place of rest, let the weary rest; 
\q2 this is the place of repose.” 
\b
\q1 But they would not listen. 
\b
\q1 
\v 13 Then the word of the LORD to them will become: 
\q2 “Order on order, order on order, 
\q2 line on line, line on line; 
\q2 a little here, a little there,” 
\q1 so that they will go stumbling backward 
\q2 and will be injured, ensnared, and captured. 
\s1 A Cornerstone in Zion
\r (1 Corinthians 3:10–15; Ephesians 2:19–22; 1 Peter 2:1–8)
\b
\q1 
\v 14 Therefore hear the word of the LORD, O scoffers 
\q2 who rule this people in Jerusalem. 
\q1 
\v 15 For you said, “We have made a covenant with death; 
\q2 we have fashioned an agreement with Sheol. 
\q1 When the overwhelming scourge passes through 
\q2 it will not touch us, 
\q1 because we have made lies our refuge 
\q2 and falsehood \f + \fr 28:15 \ft Or false gods\f* our hiding place.” 
\b
\m 
\v 16 So this is what the Lord GOD says: 
\b
\q1 “See, I lay a stone in Zion, 
\q2 a tested stone, 
\q1 a precious cornerstone, a sure foundation; 
\q2 the one who believes will never be shaken.\f + \fr 28:16 \ft LXX will never be put to shame; cited in Romans 9:33, Romans 10:11, and 1 Peter 2:6\f* 
\q1 
\v 17 I will make justice the measuring line 
\q2 and righteousness the level. 
\q1 Hail will sweep away your refuge of lies, 
\q2 and water will flood your hiding place. 
\q1 
\v 18 Your covenant with death will be dissolved, 
\q2 and your agreement with Sheol will not stand. 
\q1 When the overwhelming scourge passes through, 
\q2 you will be trampled by it. 
\q1 
\v 19 As often as it passes through, 
\q2 it will carry you away; 
\q1 it will sweep through morning after morning, 
\q2 by day and by night.” 
\b
\q1 The understanding of this message 
\q2 will bring sheer terror. 
\q1 
\v 20 Indeed, the bed is too short to stretch out on, 
\q2 and the blanket too small to wrap around you. 
\q1 
\v 21 For the LORD will rise up as at Mount Perazim. 
\q2 He will rouse Himself as in the Valley of Gibeon, 
\q1 to do His work, His strange work, 
\q2 and to perform His task, His disturbing task. 
\b
\q1 
\v 22 So now, do not mock, 
\q2 or your shackles will become heavier. 
\q1 Indeed, I have heard from the Lord GOD of Hosts 
\q2 a decree of destruction against the whole land. 
\s1 Listen and Hear
\b
\q1 
\v 23 Listen and hear my voice. 
\q2 Pay attention and hear what I say. 
\q1 
\v 24 Does the plowman plow for planting every day? 
\q2 Does he continuously loosen and harrow the soil? 
\q1 
\v 25 When he has leveled its surface, 
\q2 does he not sow caraway and scatter cumin? 
\q1 He plants wheat in rows and barley in plots, 
\q2 and rye within its border. 
\b
\q1 
\v 26 For his God instructs 
\q2 and teaches him properly. 
\q1 
\v 27 Surely caraway is not threshed with a sledge, 
\q2 and the wheel of a cart is not rolled over the cumin. 
\q1 But caraway is beaten out with a stick, 
\q2 and cumin with a rod. 
\q1 
\v 28 Grain for bread must be ground, 
\q2 but it is not endlessly threshed. 
\q1 Though the wheels of the cart roll over it, 
\q2 the horses do not crush it. 
\q1 
\v 29 This also comes from the LORD of Hosts, 
\q2 who is wonderful in counsel 
\q2 and excellent in wisdom. 
\c 29
\s1 Woe to David’s City
\r (Luke 19:41–44)
\b
\q1 
\v 1 Woe to you, O Ariel,\f + \fr 29:1 \ft Or Altar Hearth or Lion of God; probably a nickname for Jerusalem; twice in this verse, twice in verse 2, and once in verse 7\f* 
\q2 the city of Ariel where David camped! 
\q1 Year upon year 
\q2 let your festivals recur. 
\q1 
\v 2 And I will constrain Ariel, 
\q2 and there will be mourning and lamentation; 
\q2 she will be like an altar hearth \f + \fr 29:2 \ft Or like Ariel; see the footnote for verse 1.\f* before Me. 
\q1 
\v 3 I will camp in a circle around you; 
\q2 I will besiege you with towers 
\q2 and set up siege works against you. 
\q1 
\v 4 You will be brought low, 
\q2 you will speak from the ground, 
\q1 and out of the dust 
\q2 your words will be muffled. 
\q1 Your voice will be like a spirit from the ground; 
\q2 your speech will whisper out of the dust. 
\b
\q1 
\v 5 But your many foes will be like fine dust, 
\q2 the multitude of the ruthless like blowing chaff. 
\q1 Then suddenly, in an instant, 
\q2 
\v 6 you will be visited by the LORD of Hosts 
\q1 with thunder and earthquake and loud noise, 
\q2 with windstorm and tempest and consuming flame of fire. 
\q1 
\v 7 All the many nations 
\q2 going out to battle against Ariel—
\q1 even all who war against her, 
\q2 laying siege and attacking her—
\q1 will be like a dream, 
\q2 like a vision in the night, 
\q1 
\v 8 as when a hungry man dreams he is eating, 
\q2 then awakens still hungry; 
\q1 as when a thirsty man dreams he is drinking, 
\q2 then awakens faint and parched. 
\q1 So will it be for all the many nations 
\q2 who go to battle against Mount Zion. 
\b
\q1 
\v 9 Stop and be astonished; 
\q2 blind yourselves and be sightless; 
\q1 be drunk, but not with wine; 
\q2 stagger, but not from strong drink. 
\q1 
\v 10 For the LORD has poured out on you 
\q2 a spirit of deep sleep. 
\q1 He has shut your eyes, O prophets; 
\q2 He has covered your heads, O seers. 
\b
\m 
\v 11 And the entire vision will be to you like the words sealed in a scroll. If it is handed to someone to read, he will say, “I cannot, because it is sealed.” 
\v 12 Or if the scroll is handed to one unable to read, he will say, “I cannot read.” 
\b
\m 
\v 13 Therefore the Lord said: 
\b
\q1 “These people draw near to Me with their mouths 
\q2 and honor Me with their lips, 
\q1 but their hearts are far from Me. 
\q2 Their worship of Me is but rules taught by men.\f + \fr 29:13 \ft Hebrew; LXX They worship Me in vain; they teach as doctrine the precepts of men. Cited in Matthew 15:8–9 and Mark 7:6–7\f* 
\q1 
\v 14 Therefore I will again confound these people 
\q2 with wonder upon wonder. 
\q1 The wisdom of the wise will vanish, 
\q2 and the intelligence of the intelligent will be hidden.\f + \fr 29:14 \ft Hebrew; LXX I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and will hide the intelligence of the intelligent. Cited in 1 Corinthians 1:19\f*” 
\b
\q1 
\v 15 Woe to those who dig deep 
\q2 to hide their plans from the LORD. 
\q1 In darkness they do their works and say, 
\q2 “Who sees us, and who will know?” 
\q1 
\v 16 You have turned things upside down, 
\q2 as if the potter were regarded as clay. 
\q1 Shall what is formed say to him who formed it, 
\q2 “He did not make me”?\f + \fr 29:16 \ft Cited in Romans 9:20\f* 
\q1 Can the pottery say of the potter, 
\q2 “He has no understanding”? 
\s1 Sanctification for the Godly
\b
\q1 
\v 17 In a very short time, 
\q2 will not Lebanon become an orchard, 
\q2 and the orchard seem like a forest? 
\q1 
\v 18 On that day the deaf will hear the words of the scroll, 
\q2 and out of the deep darkness the eyes of the blind will see. 
\q1 
\v 19 The humble will increase their joy in the LORD, 
\q2 and the poor among men will rejoice in the Holy One of Israel. 
\b
\q1 
\v 20 For the ruthless will vanish, 
\q2 the mockers will disappear, 
\q1 and all who look for evil 
\q2 will be cut down—
\q1 
\v 21 those who indict a man with a word, 
\q2 who ensnare the mediator at the gate, 
\q1 and who with false charges 
\q2 deprive the innocent of justice. 
\b
\m 
\v 22 Therefore the LORD who redeemed Abraham says of the house of Jacob: 
\b
\q1 “No longer will Jacob be ashamed 
\q2 and no more will his face grow pale. 
\q1 
\v 23 For when he sees his children around him, 
\q2 the work of My hands, 
\q1 they will honor My name, 
\q2 they will sanctify the Holy One of Jacob, 
\q1 and they will stand in awe 
\q2 of the God of Israel. 
\q1 
\v 24 Then the wayward in spirit will come to understanding, 
\q2 and those who grumble will accept instruction.” 
\c 30
\s1 The Worthless Treaty with Egypt
\b
\q1 
\v 1 “Woe to the rebellious children,” 
\q2 declares the LORD, 
\q1 “to those who carry out a plan that is not Mine, 
\q2 who form an alliance, but against My will, 
\q2 heaping up sin upon sin. 
\q1 
\v 2 They set out to go down to Egypt 
\q2 without asking My advice, 
\q1 to seek shelter under Pharaoh’s protection 
\q2 and take refuge in Egypt’s shade. 
\b
\q1 
\v 3 But Pharaoh’s protection will become your shame, 
\q2 and the refuge of Egypt’s shade your disgrace. 
\q1 
\v 4 For though their princes are at Zoan 
\q2 and their envoys have arrived in Hanes, 
\q1 
\v 5 everyone will be put to shame 
\q2 because of a people useless to them. 
\q1 They cannot be of help; 
\q2 they are good for nothing but shame and reproach.” 
\b
\m 
\v 6 This is the burden against the beasts of the Negev: 
\b
\q1 Through a land of hardship and distress, 
\q2 of lioness and lion, 
\q2 of viper and flying serpent, 
\q1 they carry their wealth on the backs of donkeys 
\q2 and their treasures on the humps of camels, 
\q2 to a people of no profit to them. 
\q1 
\v 7 Egypt’s help is futile and empty; 
\q2 therefore I have called her 
\q2 Rahab Who Sits Still.\f + \fr 30:7 \ft Hebrew Rahab-hem-shebeth\f* 
\b
\q1 
\v 8 Go now, write it on a tablet in their presence 
\q2 and inscribe it on a scroll; 
\q1 it will be for the days to come, 
\q2 a witness forever and ever. 
\q1 
\v 9 These are rebellious people, deceitful children, 
\q2 children unwilling to obey the LORD’s instruction. 
\q1 
\v 10 They say to the seers, 
\q2 “Stop seeing visions!” 
\q1 and to the prophets, 
\q2 “Do not prophesy to us the truth! 
\q1 Speak to us pleasant words; 
\q2 prophesy illusions. 
\q1 
\v 11 Get out of the way; turn off the road. 
\q2 Rid us of the Holy One of Israel!” 
\b
\m 
\v 12 Therefore this is what the Holy One of Israel says: 
\b
\q1 “Because you have rejected this message, 
\q2 trusting in oppression and relying on deceit, 
\q1 
\v 13 this iniquity of yours is like a breach about to fail, 
\q2 a bulge in a high wall, 
\q1 whose collapse will come suddenly—
\q2 in an instant! 
\q1 
\v 14 It will break in pieces like a potter’s jar, 
\q2 shattered so that no fragment can be found. 
\q1 Not a shard will be found in the dust 
\q2 large enough to scoop the coals from a hearth 
\q2 or to skim the water from a cistern.” 
\b
\m 
\v 15 For the Lord GOD, the Holy One of Israel, has said: 
\b
\q1 “By repentance and rest 
\q2 you would be saved; 
\q1 your strength would lie in quiet confidence—
\q2 but you were not willing.” 
\b
\q1 
\v 16 “No,” you say, “we will flee on horses.” 
\q2 Therefore you will flee! 
\q1 “We will ride swift horses,” 
\q2 but your pursuers will be faster. 
\q1 
\v 17 A thousand will flee at the threat of one; 
\q2 at the threat of five you will all flee, 
\q1 until you are left alone like a pole on a mountaintop, 
\q2 like a banner on a hill. 
\s1 God Will Be Gracious
\b
\q1 
\v 18 Therefore the LORD longs to be gracious to you; 
\q2 therefore He rises to show you compassion, 
\q1 for the LORD is a just God. 
\q2 Blessed are all who wait for Him. 
\b
\m 
\v 19 O people in Zion who dwell in Jerusalem, you will weep no more. He will surely be gracious when you cry for help; when He hears, He will answer you. 
\v 20 The Lord will give you the bread of adversity and the water of affliction, but your Teacher will no longer hide Himself—with your own eyes you will see Him. 
\b
\m 
\v 21 And whether you turn to the right or to the left, your ears will hear this command behind you: “This is the way. Walk in it.” 
\v 22 So you will desecrate your silver-plated idols and your gold-plated images. You will throw them away like menstrual cloths, saying to them, “Be gone!” 
\b
\m 
\v 23 Then He will send rain for the seed that you have sown in the ground, and the food that comes from your land will be rich and plentiful. On that day your cattle will graze in open pastures. 
\v 24 The oxen and donkeys that work the ground will eat salted fodder, winnowed with shovel and pitchfork. 
\b
\m 
\v 25 And from every high mountain and every raised hill, streams of water will flow in the day of great slaughter, when the towers fall. 
\v 26 The light of the moon will be as bright as the sun, and the light of the sun will be seven times brighter—like the light of seven days—on the day that the LORD binds up the brokenness of His people and heals the wounds He has inflicted. 
\b
\q1 
\v 27 Behold, the Name of the LORD comes from afar, 
\q2 with burning anger and dense smoke. 
\q1 His lips are full of fury, 
\q2 and His tongue is like a consuming fire. 
\q1 
\v 28 His breath is like a rushing torrent 
\q2 that rises to the neck. 
\q1 He comes to sift the nations in a sieve of destruction; 
\q2 He bridles the jaws of the peoples to lead them astray. 
\b
\q1 
\v 29 You will sing 
\q2 as on the night of a holy festival, 
\q1 and your heart will rejoice 
\q2 like one who walks to the music of a flute, 
\q1 going up to the mountain of the LORD, 
\q2 to the Rock of Israel. 
\q1 
\v 30 And the LORD will cause His majestic voice to be heard 
\q2 and His mighty arm to be revealed, 
\q1 striking in angry wrath with a flame of consuming fire, 
\q2 and with cloudburst, storm, and hailstones. 
\b
\q1 
\v 31 For Assyria will be shattered at the voice of the LORD; 
\q2 He will strike them with His scepter. 
\q1 
\v 32 And with every stroke of the rod of punishment \f + \fr 30:32 \ft Some Hebrew manuscripts, Syriac; MT the rod of foundation; DSS the rod of His foundation\f* 
\q2 that the LORD brings down on them, 
\q1 the tambourines and lyres will sound 
\q2 as He battles with weapons brandished. 
\q1 
\v 33 For Topheth has long been prepared; 
\q2 it has been made ready for the king. 
\q1 Its funeral pyre is deep and wide, 
\q2 with plenty of fire and wood. 
\q1 The breath of the LORD, like a torrent of burning sulfur, 
\q2 sets it ablaze. 
\c 31
\s1 Woe to Those Who Rely on Egypt
\b
\q1 
\v 1 Woe to those who go down to Egypt for help, 
\q2 who rely on horses, 
\q1 who trust in their abundance of chariots 
\q2 and in their multitude of horsemen. 
\q1 They do not look to the Holy One of Israel; 
\q2 they do not seek the LORD. 
\q1 
\v 2 Yet He too is wise and brings disaster; 
\q2 He does not call back His words. 
\q1 He will rise up against the house of the wicked 
\q2 and against the allies of evildoers. 
\q1 
\v 3 But the Egyptians are men, not God; 
\q2 their horses are flesh, not spirit. 
\q1 When the LORD stretches out His hand, 
\q2 the helper will stumble, 
\q1 and the one he helps will fall; 
\q2 both will perish together. 
\b
\m 
\v 4 For this is what the LORD has said to me: 
\b
\q1 “Like a lion roaring 
\q2 or a young lion over its prey—
\q1 and though a band of shepherds is called out against it, 
\q2 it is not terrified by their shouting 
\q2 or subdued by their clamor—
\q1 so the LORD of Hosts will come down 
\q2 to do battle on Mount Zion and its heights. 
\q1 
\v 5 Like birds hovering overhead, 
\q2 so the LORD of Hosts will protect Jerusalem. 
\q1 He will shield it and deliver it; 
\q2 He will pass over it and preserve it.” 
\b
\m 
\v 6 Return to the One against whom you have so blatantly rebelled, O children of Israel. 
\v 7 For on that day, every one of you will reject the idols of silver and gold that your own hands have sinfully made. 
\b
\q1 
\v 8 “Then Assyria will fall, 
\q2 but not by the sword of man; 
\q1 a sword will devour them, 
\q2 but not one made by mortals. 
\q1 They will flee before the sword, 
\q2 and their young men will be put to forced labor. 
\q1 
\v 9 Their rock will pass away for fear, 
\q2 and their princes will panic at the sight of the battle standard,” 
\q1 declares the LORD, whose fire is in Zion, 
\q2 whose furnace is in Jerusalem. 
\c 32
\s1 A Righteous King
\b
\q1 
\v 1 Behold, a king will reign in righteousness, 
\q2 and princes will rule with justice. 
\q1 
\v 2 Each will be like a shelter from the wind, 
\q2 a refuge from the storm, 
\q1 like streams of water in a dry land, 
\q2 like the shadow of a great rock in an arid land. 
\q1 
\v 3 Then the eyes of those who see will no longer be closed, 
\q2 and the ears of those who hear will listen. 
\q1 
\v 4 The mind of the rash will know and understand, 
\q2 and the stammering tongue will speak clearly and fluently. 
\b
\q1 
\v 5 No longer will a fool be called noble, 
\q2 nor a scoundrel be respected. 
\q1 
\v 6 For a fool speaks foolishness; 
\q2 his mind plots iniquity. 
\q1 He practices ungodliness 
\q2 and speaks falsely about the LORD; 
\q1 he leaves the hungry empty 
\q2 and deprives the thirsty of drink. 
\q1 
\v 7 The weapons of the scoundrel are destructive; 
\q2 he hatches plots to destroy the poor with lies, 
\q2 even when the plea of the needy is just. 
\q1 
\v 8 But a noble man makes honorable plans; 
\q2 he stands up for worthy causes. 
\s1 The Women of Jerusalem
\b
\q1 
\v 9 Stand up, you complacent women; 
\q2 listen to me. 
\q1 Give ear to my word, 
\q2 you overconfident daughters. 
\q1 
\v 10 In a little more than a year you will tremble, 
\q2 O secure ones. 
\q1 For the grape harvest will fail 
\q2 and the fruit harvest will not arrive. 
\b
\q1 
\v 11 Shudder, you ladies of leisure; 
\q2 tremble, you daughters of complacency. 
\q1 Strip yourselves bare 
\q2 and put sackcloth around your waists. 
\q1 
\v 12 Beat your breasts for the pleasant fields, 
\q2 for the fruitful vines, 
\q1 
\v 13 and for the land of my people, 
\q2 overgrown with thorns and briers—
\q1 even for every house of merriment 
\q2 in this city of revelry. 
\b
\q1 
\v 14 For the palace will be forsaken, 
\q2 the busy city abandoned. 
\q1 The hill \f + \fr 32:14 \ft Hebrew the Ophel\f* and the watchtower will become caves forever—
\q2 the delight of wild donkeys 
\q2 and a pasture for flocks—
\q1 
\v 15 until the Spirit is poured out 
\q2 upon us from on high. 
\b
\q1 Then the desert will be an orchard, 
\q2 and the orchard will seem like a forest. 
\q1 
\v 16 Then justice will inhabit the wilderness, 
\q2 and righteousness will dwell in the fertile field. 
\q1 
\v 17 The work of righteousness will be peace; 
\q2 the service of righteousness will be quiet confidence forever. 
\b
\q1 
\v 18 Then my people will dwell in a peaceful place, 
\q2 in safe and secure places of rest. 
\q1 
\v 19 But hail will level the forest, 
\q2 and the city will sink to the depths. 
\b
\q1 
\v 20 Blessed are those who sow beside abundant waters, 
\q2 who let the ox and donkey range freely. 
\c 33
\s1 The LORD Is Exalted
\b
\q1 
\v 1 Woe to you, O destroyer never destroyed, 
\q2 O traitor never betrayed!

\q1 
\v 13 You who are far off, hear what I have done;

\b
\q1 
\v 14 The sinners in Zion are afraid; 
\q2 trembling grips the ungodly: 
\q1 “Who of us can dwell with a consuming fire? 
\q2 Who of us can dwell with everlasting flames?” 
\q1 
\v 15 He who walks righteously

\b
\q1 
\v 5 When My sword has drunk its fill in the heavens,

\q1 
\v 6 The sword of the LORD is bathed in blood. 
\q2 It drips with fat—
\q1 with the blood of lambs and goats, 
\q2 with the fat of the kidneys of rams. 
\q1 For the LORD has a sacrifice in Bozrah, 
\q2 a great slaughter in the land of Edom. 
\q1 
\v 7 And the wild oxen will fall with them, 
\q2 the young bulls with the strong ones. 
\q1 Their land will be drenched with blood, 
\q2 and their soil will be soaked with fat.

\q1

\q1 
\v 10 It will not be quenched—day or night. 
\q2 Its smoke will ascend forever. 
\q1 From generation to generation it will lie desolate; 
\q2 no one will ever again pass through it. 
\q1 
\v 11 The desert owl and screech owl will possess it, 
\q2 and the great owl and raven will dwell in it.\f + \fr 34:11 \ft The precise identification of these birds is uncertain.\f* 
\b
\q1 The LORD will stretch out over Edom 
\q2 a measuring line of chaos 
\q2 and a plumb line of destruction. 
\q1 
\v 12 No nobles will be left to proclaim a king, 
\q2 and all her princes will come to nothing. 
\q1 
\v 13 Her towers will be overgrown with thorns, 
\q2 her fortresses with thistles and briers. 
\q1 She will become a haunt for jackals,\f + \fr 34:13 \ft Or serpents or dragons\f* 
\q2 an abode for ostriches.\f + \fr 34:13 \ft Literally for daughters of an ostrich or for daughters of an owl\f*

\v 14 The desert creatures will meet with hyenas, 
\q2 and one wild goat will call to another. 
\q1 There the night creature \f + \fr 34:14 \ft Hebrew Lilith\f* will settle 
\q2 and find her place of repose. 
\q1 
\v 15 There the owl will make her nest; 
\q2 she will lay and hatch her eggs 
\q2 and gather her brood under her shadow. 
\q1 Even there the birds of prey will gather, 
\q2 each with its mate. 
\b
\m 
\v 16 Search and read the scroll of the LORD: 
\b
\q1 Not one of these will go missing, 
\q2 not one will lack her mate, 
\q1 because He has ordered it by His mouth, 
\q2 and He will gather them by His Spirit. 
\q1

\v 2 It will bloom profusely 
\q2 and rejoice with joy and singing. 
\q1 The glory of Lebanon will be given to it, 
\q2 the splendor of Carmel and Sharon. 
\q1 They will see the glory of the LORD, 
\q2 the splendor of our God.

\q2 and steady the feeble knees!\f + \fr 35:3 \ft Cited in Hebrews 12:12\f* 
\q1 
\v 4 Say to those with anxious hearts: 
\q2 “Be strong, do not fear! 
\q1 Behold, your God will come with vengeance. 
\q2 With divine retribution He will come to save you.” 
\b
\q1 
\v 5 Then the eyes of the blind will be opened 
\q2 and the ears of the deaf unstopped. 
\q1 
\v 6 Then the lame will leap like a deer 
\q2 and the mute tongue will shout for joy. 
\q1 For waters will gush forth in the wilderness, 
\q2 and streams in the desert. 
\q1 
\v 7 The parched ground will become a pool, 
\q2 the thirsty land springs of water. 
\q1 In the haunt where jackals \f + \fr 35:7 \ft Or serpents or dragons\f* once lay, 
\q2 there will be grass and reeds and papyrus. 
\b
\q1 
\v 8 And there will be a highway 
\q2 called the Way of Holiness. 
\q1 The unclean will not travel it—
\q2 only those who walk in the Way—
\q2 and fools will not stray onto it. 
\q1 
\v 9 No lion will be there, 
\q2 and no vicious beast will go up on it. 
\q1 Such will not be found there, 
\q2 but the redeemed will walk upon it. 
\q1 
\v 10 So the redeemed of the LORD will return 
\q2 and enter Zion with singing, 
\q2 crowned with everlasting joy. 
\q1 Gladness and joy will overtake them, 
\q2 and sorrow and sighing will flee.

\s1 Sennacherib Threatens Jerusalem
\r (2 Kings 18:13–37; 2 Chronicles 32:1–8)
\b
\m 
\v 1 In the fourteenth year of Hezekiah’s reign, Sennacherib king of Assyria attacked and captured all the fortified cities of Judah. 
\v 2 And the king of Assyria sent the Rabshakeh,\f + \fr 36:2 \ft Hebrew Rabshakeh is the title of a high-ranking Assyrian military officer; here and throughout chapters 36 and 37, as well as 2 Kings 18 and 19\f* with a great army, from Lachish to King Hezekiah at Jerusalem. And he stopped by the aqueduct of the upper pool, on the road to the Launderer’s Field. 
\b
\m 
\v 3 Then Eliakim son of Hilkiah the palace administrator, Shebna the scribe, and Joah son of Asaph the recorder, went out to him. 
\b
\m 
\v 4 The Rabshakeh said to them, “Tell Hezekiah that this is what the great king, the king of Assyria, says: What is the basis of this confidence of yours? 
\v 5 You claim to have \f + \fr 36:5 \ft Literally You speak; see DSS and 2 Kings 18:20; MT I speak.\f* a strategy and strength for war, but these are empty words. In whom are you now trusting, that you have rebelled against me? 
\b
\m 
\v 6 Look now, you are trusting in Egypt, that splintered reed of a staff that will pierce the hand of anyone who leans on it. Such is Pharaoh king of Egypt to all who trust in him. 
\v 7 But if you say to me, ‘We trust in the LORD our God,’ is He not the One whose high places and altars Hezekiah has removed, saying to Judah and Jerusalem, ‘You must worship before this altar’? 
\b
\m 
\v 8 Now, therefore, make a bargain with my master, the king of Assyria. I will give you two thousand horses—if you can put riders on them! 
\v 9 For how can you repel a single officer among the least of my master’s servants when you depend on Egypt for chariots and horsemen? 
\v 10 So now, was it apart from the LORD that I have come up against this land to destroy it? The LORD Himself said to me, ‘Go up against this land and destroy it.’” 
\b
\m 
\v 11 Then Eliakim, Shebna, and Joah said to the Rabshakeh, “Please speak to your servants in Aramaic, since we understand it. Do not speak to us in Hebrew \f + \fr 36:11 \ft Or in the dialect of Judah; also in verse 13\f* in the hearing of the people on the wall.” 
\b
\m 
\v 12 But the Rabshakeh replied, “Has my master sent me to speak these words only to you and your master, and not to the men sitting on the wall, who are destined with you to eat their own dung and drink their own urine?” 
\b
\m 
\v 13 Then the Rabshakeh stood and called out loudly in Hebrew: “Hear the words of the great king, the king of Assyria! 
\v 14 This is what the king says: Do not let Hezekiah deceive you, for he cannot deliver you. 
\v 15 Do not let Hezekiah persuade you to trust in the LORD when he says, ‘The LORD will surely deliver us; this city will not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria.’ 
\b
\m 
\v 16 Do not listen to Hezekiah, for this is what the king of Assyria says: Make peace with me \f + \fr 36:16 \ft Or Make a blessing with me\f* and come out to me. Then every one of you will eat from his own vine and his own fig tree, and drink water from his own cistern, 
\v 17 until I come and take you away to a land like your own—a land of grain and new wine, a land of bread and vineyards. 
\b
\m 
\v 18 Do not let Hezekiah mislead you when he says, ‘The LORD will deliver us.’ Has the god of any nation ever delivered his land from the hand of the king of Assyria? 
\v 19 Where are the gods of Hamath and Arpad? Where are the gods of Sepharvaim? Have they delivered Samaria from my hand? 
\v 20 Who among all the gods of these lands has delivered his land from my hand? How then can the LORD deliver Jerusalem from my hand?” 
\b
\m 
\v 21 But the people remained silent and did not answer a word, for Hezekiah had commanded, “Do not answer him.” 
\b
\m 
\v 22 Then Hilkiah’s son Eliakim the palace administrator, Shebna the scribe, and Asaph’s son Joah the recorder came to Hezekiah with their clothes torn, and they relayed to him the words of the Rabshakeh. 
\c 37
\s1 Isaiah’s Message of Deliverance
\r (2 Kings 19:1–7)
\b
\m 
\v 1 On hearing this report, King Hezekiah tore his clothes, put on sackcloth, and entered the house of the LORD. 
\v 2 And he sent Eliakim the palace administrator, Shebna the scribe, and the leading priests, all wearing sackcloth, to the prophet Isaiah son of Amoz 
\v 3 to tell him, “This is what Hezekiah says: Today is a day of distress, rebuke, and disgrace; for children have come to the point of birth, but there is no strength to deliver them. 
\v 4 Perhaps the LORD your God will hear the words of the Rabshakeh, whom his master the king of Assyria has sent to defy the living God, and He will rebuke him for the words that the LORD your God has heard. Therefore lift up a prayer for the remnant that still survives.” 
\b
\m 
\v 5 So the servants of King Hezekiah went to Isaiah, 
\v 6 who replied, “Tell your master that this is what the LORD says: ‘Do not be afraid of the words you have heard, with which the servants of the king of Assyria have blasphemed Me. 
\v 7 Behold, I will put a spirit in him so that he will hear a rumor and return to his own land, where I will cause him to fall by the sword.’” 
\s1 Sennacherib’s Blasphemous Letter
\r (2 Kings 19:8–13)
\b
\m 
\v 8 When the Rabshakeh heard that the king of Assyria had left Lachish, he withdrew and found the king fighting against Libnah. 
\b
\m 
\v 9 Now Sennacherib had been warned about Tirhakah king of Cush:\f + \fr 37:9 \ft That is, the upper Nile region\f* “He has set out to fight against you.” 
\b
\m On hearing this, Sennacherib sent messengers to Hezekiah, saying, 
\v 10 “Give this message to Hezekiah king of Judah: 
\b
\pmo ‘Do not let your God, in whom you trust, deceive you by saying that Jerusalem will not be delivered into the hand of the king of Assyria. 
\v 11 Surely you have heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all the other countries, devoting them to destruction.\f + \fr 37:11 \ft Forms of the Hebrew cherem refer to the giving over of things or persons, either by destroying them or by giving them as an offering.\f* Will you then be spared? 
\v 12 Did the gods of the nations destroyed by my fathers rescue those nations—the gods of Gozan, Haran, and Rezeph, and of the people of Eden in Telassar? 
\v 13 Where are the kings of Hamath, Arpad, Sepharvaim, Hena, and Ivvah?’” 
\s1 Hezekiah’s Prayer
\r (2 Kings 19:14–19)
\b
\m 
\v 14 So Hezekiah received the letter from the messengers, read it, and went up to the house of the LORD and spread it out before the LORD. 
\v 15 And Hezekiah prayed to the LORD: 
\b
\pmo 
\v 16 “O LORD of Hosts, God of Israel, enthroned above the cherubim, You alone are God over all the kingdoms of the earth. You made the heavens and the earth. 
\v 17 Incline Your ear, O LORD, and hear; open Your eyes, O LORD, and see. Listen to all the words that Sennacherib has sent to defy the living God. 
\b
\pmo 
\v 18 Truly, O LORD, the kings of Assyria have laid waste all these countries and their lands. 
\v 19 They have cast their gods into the fire and destroyed them, for they were not gods, but only wood and stone—the work of human hands. 
\b
\pmo 
\v 20 And now, O LORD our God, save us from his hand, so that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that You alone, O LORD, are God.\f + \fr 37:20 \ft DSS (see also 2 Kings 19:19); MT You alone are the LORD\f*” 
\s1 Sennacherib’s Fall Prophesied
\r (2 Kings 19:20–34)
\b
\m 
\v 21 Then Isaiah son of Amoz sent a message to Hezekiah: “This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says: Because you have prayed to Me concerning Sennacherib king of Assyria, 
\v 22 this is the word that the LORD has spoken against him: 
\b
\q1 ‘The Virgin Daughter of Zion 
\q2 despises you and mocks you; 
\q1 the Daughter of Jerusalem 
\q2 shakes her head behind you. 
\q1 
\v 23 Whom have you taunted and blasphemed? 
\q2 Against whom have you raised your voice 
\q1 and lifted your eyes in pride? 
\q2 Against the Holy One of Israel! 
\b
\q1 
\v 24 Through your servants you have taunted the Lord, 
\q2 and you have said: 
\q1 “With my many chariots 
\q2 I have ascended 
\q1 to the heights of the mountains, 
\q2 to the remote peaks of Lebanon. 
\q1 I have cut down its tallest cedars, 
\q2 the finest of its cypresses.\f + \fr 37:24 \ft Or pines or junipers or firs\f* 
\q1 I have reached its farthest heights, 
\q2 the densest of its forests. 
\q1 
\v 25 I have dug wells 
\q2 and drunk foreign \f + \fr 37:25 \ft DSS (see also 2 Kings 19:24); MT does not include foreign.\f* waters. 
\q1 With the soles of my feet 
\q2 I have dried up all the streams of Egypt.” 
\b
\q1 
\v 26 Have you not heard? 
\q2 Long ago I ordained it; 
\q1 in days of old I planned it. 
\q2 Now I have brought it to pass, 
\q1 that you should crush fortified cities 
\q2 into piles of rubble. 
\q1 
\v 27 Therefore their inhabitants, devoid of power, 
\q2 are dismayed and ashamed. 
\q1 They are like plants in the field, 
\q2 tender green shoots, 
\q1 grass on the rooftops, 
\q2 scorched \f + \fr 37:27 \ft DSS, some MT manuscripts, and some LXX manuscripts (see also 2 Kings 19:26); most MT manuscripts on the rooftops and terraced fields\f* before it is grown. 
\b
\q1 
\v 28 But I know your sitting down, 
\q2 your going out and coming in, 
\q2 and your raging against Me. 
\q1 
\v 29 Because your rage and arrogance against Me 
\q2 have reached My ears, 
\q1 I will put My hook in your nose 
\q2 and My bit in your mouth; 
\q1 I will send you back 
\q2 the way you came.’ 
\b
\m 
\v 30 And this will be a sign to you, O Hezekiah: 
\b
\q1 This year you will eat 
\q2 what grows on its own, 
\q1 and in the second year 
\q2 what springs from the same. 
\q1 But in the third year you will sow and reap; 
\q2 you will plant vineyards and eat their fruit. 
\q1 
\v 31 And the surviving remnant of the house of Judah 
\q2 will again take root below 
\q2 and bear fruit above. 
\q1 
\v 32 For a remnant will go forth from Jerusalem, 
\q2 and survivors from Mount Zion. 
\q1 The zeal of the LORD of Hosts 
\q2 will accomplish this. 
\b
\m 
\v 33 So this is what the LORD says about the king of Assyria: 
\b
\q1 ‘He will not enter this city 
\q2 or shoot an arrow into it. 
\q1 He will not come before it with a shield 
\q2 or build up a siege ramp against it. 
\q1 
\v 34 He will go back the way he came, 
\q2 and he will not enter this city,’ 
\qr declares the LORD. 
\q1 
\v 35 ‘I will defend this city 
\q2 and save it 
\q1 for My own sake 
\q2 and for the sake of My servant David.’” 
\s1 Jerusalem Delivered from the Assyrians
\r (2 Kings 19:35–37; 2 Chronicles 32:20–23)
\b

\v 36 Then the angel of the LORD went out and struck down 185,000 men in the camp of the Assyrians. When the people got up \f + \fr 37:36 \ft Hebrew When they got up\f* the next morning, there were all the dead bodies! 
\b
\m 
\v 37 So Sennacherib king of Assyria broke camp and withdrew. He returned to Nineveh and stayed there. 
\v 38 One day, while he was worshiping in the temple of his god Nisroch, his sons Adrammelech and Sharezer put him to the sword and escaped to the land of Ararat. And his son Esar-haddon reigned in his place.

\s1 Hezekiah’s Illness and Recovery
\r (2 Kings 20:1–11; 2 Chronicles 32:24–31)
\b
\m 
\v 1 In those days Hezekiah became mortally ill. The prophet Isaiah son of Amoz came to him and said, “This is what the LORD says: ‘Put your house in order, for you are about to die; you will not recover.’” 
\b
\m 
\v 2 Then Hezekiah turned his face to the wall and prayed to the LORD, 
\v 3 saying, “Please, O LORD, remember how I have walked before You faithfully and with wholehearted devotion; I have done what was good in Your sight.” And Hezekiah wept bitterly. 
\b
\m 
\v 4 And the word of the LORD came to Isaiah, saying, 
\v 5 “Go and tell Hezekiah that this is what the LORD, the God of your father David, says: ‘I have heard your prayer; I have seen your tears. Behold, I will add fifteen years to your life. 
\v 6 And I will deliver you and this city from the hand of the king of Assyria. I will defend this city.\f + \fr 38:6 \ft MT and LXX; DSS includes for My sake and for the sake of My servant David; see 2 Kings 20:6.\f* 
\v 7 This will be a sign to you from the LORD that He will do what He has promised: 
\v 8 I will make the sun’s shadow that falls on the stairway of Ahaz go back ten steps.’” 
\b
\m So the sunlight went back the ten steps it had descended. 
\s1 Hezekiah’s Song of Thanksgiving
\b
\m 
\v 9 This is a writing by Hezekiah king of Judah after his illness and recovery: 
\b
\q1 
\v 10 I said, “In the prime \f + \fr 38:10 \ft Or In the quiet or In the middle\f* of my life 
\q2 I must go through the gates of Sheol 
\q2 and be deprived of the remainder of my years.” 
\q1 
\v 11 I said, “I will never again see the LORD, 
\q2 even the LORD, in the land of the living; 
\q1 I will no longer look on mankind 
\q2 with those who dwell in this world. 
\q1 
\v 12 My dwelling has been picked up and removed from me 
\q2 like a shepherd’s tent. 
\q1 I have rolled up my life like a weaver; 
\q2 He cuts me off from the loom; 
\q2 from day until night You make an end of me. 
\q1 
\v 13 I composed myself \f + \fr 38:13 \ft Or I cried out; see Targum Yonaton.\f* until the morning. 
\q2 Like a lion He breaks all my bones; 
\q2 from day until night You make an end of me. 
\q1 
\v 14 I chirp like a swallow or crane; 
\q2 I moan like a dove. 
\q1 My eyes grow weak as I look upward. 
\q2 O Lord, I am oppressed; be my security.” 
\b
\q1 
\v 15 What can I say? 
\q2 He has spoken to me, and He Himself has done this. 
\q1 I will walk slowly all my years 
\q2 because of the anguish of my soul. 
\q1 
\v 16 O Lord, by such things men live, 
\q2 and in all of them my spirit finds life. 
\q1 You have restored me to health 
\q2 and have let me live. 
\q1 
\v 17 Surely for my own welfare 
\q2 I had such great anguish; 
\q1 but Your love has delivered me from the pit of oblivion, 
\q2 for You have cast all my sins behind Your back. 
\q1 
\v 18 For Sheol cannot thank You; 
\q2 Death cannot praise You. 
\q1 Those who descend to the Pit 
\q2 cannot hope for Your faithfulness. 
\q1

\v 21 Now Isaiah had said, “Prepare a lump of pressed figs and apply it to the boil, and he will recover.”

\s1 Hezekiah Shows His Treasures
\r (2 Kings 20:12–19)
\b
\m 
\v 1 At that time Merodach-baladan son of Baladan king of Babylon sent letters and a gift to Hezekiah, for he had heard about Hezekiah’s illness and recovery. 
\v 2 And Hezekiah welcomed the envoys gladly and showed them what was in his treasure house—the silver, the gold, the spices, and the precious oil, as well as his entire armory—all that was found in his storehouses. There was nothing in his palace or in all his dominion that Hezekiah did not show them. 
\b
\m 
\v 3 Then the prophet Isaiah went to King Hezekiah and asked, “Where did those men come from, and what did they say to you?” 
\b
\m “They came to me from a distant land,” Hezekiah replied, “from Babylon.” 
\b
\m 
\v 4 “What have they seen in your palace?” Isaiah asked. 
\b
\m “They have seen everything in my palace,” answered Hezekiah. “There is nothing among my treasures that I did not show them.” 
\b
\m 
\v 5 Then Isaiah said to Hezekiah, “Hear the word of the LORD of Hosts: 
\v 6 The time will surely come when everything in your palace and all that your fathers have stored up until this day will be carried off to Babylon. Nothing will be left, says the LORD. 
\v 7 And some of your descendants, your own flesh and blood, will be taken away to be eunuchs in the palace of the king of Babylon.” 
\b
\m 
\v 8 But Hezekiah said to Isaiah, “The word of the LORD that you have spoken is good.” For he thought, “At least there will be peace and security in my lifetime.”

\q1 I have not burdened you with offerings, 
\q2 nor wearied you with frankincense. 
\q1 
\v 24 You have not bought Me sweet cane with your silver, 
\q2 nor satisfied Me with the fat of your sacrifices. 
\q1 But you have burdened Me with your sins; 
\q2 you have wearied Me with your iniquities.

\q1 
\v 25 I, yes I, am He 
\q2 who blots out your transgressions for My own sake 
\q2 and remembers your sins no more. 
\q1 
\v 26 Remind Me, let us argue the matter together. 
\q2 State your case, so that you may be vindicated. 
\q1 
\v 27 Your first father sinned, 
\q2 and your spokesmen rebelled against Me. 
\q1 
\v 28 So I will disgrace the princes of your sanctuary, 
\q2 and I will devote Jacob to destruction \f + \fr 43:28 \ft Forms of the Hebrew cherem refer to the giving over of things or persons to the LORD, either by destroying them or by giving them as an offering.\f* and Israel to reproach.”

\s1 The LORD Has Chosen Israel
\b
\q1 
\v 1 But now listen, O Jacob My servant, 
\q2 Israel, whom I have chosen. 
\q1 
\v 2 This is the word of the LORD, your Maker, 
\q2 who formed you from the womb and who will help you: 
\q1 “Do not be afraid, O Jacob My servant, 
\q2 Jeshurun,\f + \fr 44:2 \ft Jeshurun means the upright one, a term of endearment for Israel.\f* whom I have chosen. 
\q1 
\v 3 For I will pour water on the thirsty land, 
\q2 and currents on the dry ground. 
\q1 I will pour out My Spirit on your descendants, 
\q2 and My blessing on your offspring. 
\q1 
\v 4 They will sprout among the grass 
\q2 like willows \f + \fr 44:4 \ft Or poplars\f* by flowing streams. 
\q1 
\v 5 One will say, ‘I belong to the LORD,’ 
\q2 another will call himself by the name of Jacob, 
\q1 and still another will write on his hand, ‘The LORD’s,’ 
\q2 and will take the name of Israel.” 
\b
\q1 
\v 6 Thus says the LORD, 
\q2 the King and Redeemer of Israel, the LORD of Hosts: 
\b
\q1 “I am the first and I am the last, 
\q2 and there is no God but Me. 
\q1 
\v 7 Who then is like Me? 
\q2 Let him say so! 
\q1 Let him declare his case before Me, 
\q2 since I established an ancient people. 
\q1 Let him foretell the things to come, 
\q2 and what is to take place. 
\q1 
\v 8 Do not tremble or fear. 
\q2 Have I not told you and declared it long ago? 
\q1 You are My witnesses! 
\q2 Is there any God but Me? 
\q1 There is no other Rock; 
\q2 I know not one.” 
\b
\q1 
\v 9 All makers of idols are nothing, 
\q2 and the things they treasure are worthless. 
\q1 Their witnesses fail to see or comprehend, 
\q2 so they are put to shame. 
\q1 
\v 10 Who fashions a god or casts an idol 
\q2 which profits him nothing? 
\q1 
\v 11 Behold, all his companions will be put to shame, 
\q2 for the craftsmen themselves are only human. 
\q1 Let them all assemble and take their stand; 
\q2 they will all be brought to terror and shame. 
\b
\q1 
\v 12 The blacksmith takes a tool 
\q2 and labors over the coals; 
\q1 he fashions an idol with hammers 
\q2 and forges it with his strong arms. 
\q1 Yet he grows hungry and loses his strength; 
\q2 he fails to drink water and grows faint. 
\q1 
\v 13 The woodworker extends a measuring line; 
\q2 he marks it out with a stylus; 
\q1 he shapes it with chisels 
\q2 and outlines it with a compass. 
\q1 He fashions it in the likeness of man, 
\q2 like man in all his glory, 
\q2 that it may dwell in a shrine. 
\q1 
\v 14 He cuts down cedars 
\q2 or retrieves a cypress \f + \fr 44:14 \ft Or pine or juniper or fir\f* or oak. 
\q1 He lets it grow strong among the trees of the forest. 
\q2 He plants a laurel, and the rain makes it grow. 
\q1 
\v 15 It serves as fuel for man. 
\q2 He takes some of it to warm himself, 
\q1 and he kindles a fire 
\q2 and bakes his bread; 
\q1 he even fashions it into a god and worships it; 
\q2 he makes an idol and bows down to it. 
\q1 
\v 16 He burns half of it in the fire, 
\q2 and he roasts meat on that half. 
\q1 He eats the roast and is satisfied. 
\q2 Indeed, he warms himself and says, 
\q2 “Ah! I am warm; I see the fire.” 
\q1 
\v 17 From the rest he makes a god, his graven image. 
\q2 He bows down to it and worships; 
\q1 he prays to it and says, 
\q2 “Save me, for you are my god.” 
\b
\q1 
\v 18 They do not comprehend or discern, 
\q2 for He has shut their eyes so they cannot see 
\q2 and closed their minds so they cannot understand. 
\q1 
\v 19 And no one considers in his heart, 
\q2 no one has the knowledge or insight to say, 
\q1 “I burned half of it in the fire, 
\q2 and I baked bread on its coals; 
\q2 I roasted meat and I ate. 
\q1 Shall I make something detestable with the rest of it? 
\q2 Shall I bow down to a block of wood?” 
\q1 
\v 20 He feeds on ashes. 
\q2 His deluded heart has led him astray, 
\q1 and he cannot deliver himself or say, 
\q2 “Is not this thing in my right hand a lie?” 
\s1 Jerusalem to Be Restored
\b
\q1 
\v 21 Remember these things, O Jacob, 
\q2 for you are My servant, O Israel. 
\q1 I have made you, and you are My servant; 
\q2 O Israel, I will never forget you. 
\q1 
\v 22 I have blotted out your transgressions like a cloud, 
\q2 and your sins like a mist. 
\q2 Return to Me, for I have redeemed you. 
\q1 
\v 23 Sing for joy, O heavens, for the LORD has done this; 
\q2 shout aloud, O depths of the earth. 
\q1 Break forth in song, O mountains, 
\q2 you forests and all your trees. 
\q1 For the LORD has redeemed Jacob, 
\q2 and revealed His glory in Israel. 
\b
\q1 
\v 24 Thus says the LORD, 
\q2 your Redeemer who formed you from the womb: 
\b
\q1 “I am the LORD, 
\q2 who has made all things, 
\q1 who alone stretched out the heavens, 
\q2 who by Myself spread out the earth, 
\q1 
\v 25 who foils the signs of false prophets 
\q2 and makes fools of diviners, 
\q1 who confounds the wise 
\q2 and turns their knowledge into nonsense, 
\q1 
\v 26 who confirms the message of His servant 
\q2 and fulfills the counsel of His messengers, 
\q1 who says of Jerusalem, 
\q2 ‘She will be inhabited,’ 
\q1 and of the cities of Judah, 
\q2 ‘They will be rebuilt, and I will restore their ruins,’ 
\q1 
\v 27 who says to the depths of the sea, 
\q2 ‘Be dry, and I will dry up your currents,’ 
\q1 
\v 28 who says of Cyrus, 
\q2 ‘My shepherd will fulfill all that I desire,’ 
\q1 who says of Jerusalem, 
\q2 ‘She will be rebuilt,’ 
\q1 and of the temple, 
\q2 ‘Let its foundation be laid.’” 
\c 45
\s1 God Calls Cyrus
\r (2 Chronicles 36:22–23; Ezra 1:1–4)
\b
\q1 
\v 1 This is what the LORD says to Cyrus His anointed, 
\q2 whose right hand I have grasped 
\q1 to subdue nations before him, 
\q2 to disarm kings, 
\q1 to open the doors before him, 
\q2 so that the gates will not be shut: 
\b
\q1 
\v 2 “I will go before you 
\q2 and level the mountains;\f + \fr 45:2 \ft DSS and LXX; MT level the terrain\f* 
\q1 I will break down the gates of bronze 
\q2 and cut through the bars of iron. 
\q1 
\v 3 I will give you the treasures of darkness 
\q2 and the riches hidden in secret places, 
\q1 so that you may know that I am the LORD, 
\q2 the God of Israel, who calls you by name. 
\q1 
\v 4 For the sake of Jacob My servant 
\q2 and Israel My chosen one, 
\q1 I call you by name; 
\q2 I have given you a title of honor, 
\q2 though you have not known Me. 
\b
\q1 
\v 5 I am the LORD, and there is no other; 
\q2 there is no God but Me. 
\q1 I will equip you for battle, 
\q2 though you have not known Me, 
\q1 
\v 6 so that all may know, 
\q2 from where the sun rises to where it sets, 
\q1 that there is none but Me; 
\q2 I am the LORD, and there is no other. 
\q1 
\v 7 I form the light and create the darkness; 
\q2 I bring prosperity and create calamity. 
\q2 I, the LORD, do all these things. 
\b
\q1 
\v 8 Drip down, O heavens, from above, 
\q2 and let the skies pour down righteousness. 
\q1 Let the earth open up that salvation may sprout 
\q2 and righteousness spring up with it; 
\q2 I, the LORD, have created it. 
\b
\q1 
\v 9 Woe to him who quarrels with his Maker—
\q2 one clay pot among many. 
\q1 Does the clay ask the potter, 
\q2 ‘What are you making?’\f + \fr 45:9 \ft Cited in Romans 9:20\f* 
\q1 Does your work say, 
\q2 ‘He has no hands’? 
\q1 
\v 10 Woe to him who says to his father, 
\q2 ‘What have you begotten?’ 
\q1 or to his mother, 
\q2 ‘What have you brought forth?’” 
\b
\q1 
\v 11 Thus says the LORD, 
\q2 the Holy One of Israel, and its Maker: 
\b
\q1 “How dare you question Me about My sons, 
\q2 or instruct Me in the work of My hands? 
\q1 
\v 12 It is I who made the earth 
\q2 and created man upon it. 
\q1 It was My hands that stretched out the heavens, 
\q2 and I ordained all their host. 
\q1 
\v 13 I will raise up Cyrus in righteousness, 
\q2 and I will make all his ways straight. 
\q1 He will rebuild My city 
\q2 and set My exiles free, 
\q1 but not for payment or reward, 
\q2 says the LORD of Hosts.” 
\b
\m 
\v 14 This is what the LORD says: 
\b
\q1 “The products of Egypt and the merchandise of Cush,\f + \fr 45:14 \ft That is, the upper Nile region\f* 
\q2 along with the Sabeans, men of stature, 
\q1 will come over to you 
\q2 and will be yours; 
\q1 they will trudge behind you; 
\q2 they will come over in chains and bow down to you. 
\q1 They will confess to you: 
\q2 ‘God is indeed with you, and there is no other; 
\q2 there is no other God.’” 
\b
\q1 
\v 15 Truly You are a God who hides Himself, 
\q2 O God of Israel, the Savior. 
\q1 
\v 16 They will all be put to shame and humiliated; 
\q2 the makers of idols will depart together in disgrace. 
\q1 
\v 17 But Israel will be saved by the LORD 
\q2 with an everlasting salvation; 
\q1 you will not be put to shame or humiliated, 
\q2 to ages everlasting. 
\b
\q1 
\v 18 For thus says the LORD, 
\q2 who created the heavens—He is God; 
\q1 He formed the earth and fashioned it; 
\q2 He established it; 
\q1 He did not create it to be empty, 
\q2 but formed it to be inhabited: 
\b
\q1 “I am the LORD, 
\q2 and there is no other. 
\q1 
\v 19 I have not spoken in secret, 
\q2 from a place in a land of darkness. 
\q1 I did not say to the descendants of Jacob, 
\q2 ‘Seek Me in a wasteland.’ 
\q1 I, the LORD, speak the truth; 
\q2 I say what is right. 
\b
\q1 
\v 20 Come, gather together, and draw near, 
\q2 you fugitives from the nations. 
\q1 Ignorant are those who carry idols of wood 
\q2 and pray to a god that cannot save. 
\q1 
\v 21 Speak up and present your case—
\q2 yes, let them take counsel together. 
\q1 Who foretold this long ago? 
\q2 Who announced it from ancient times? 
\q1 Was it not I, the LORD? 
\q2 There is no other God but Me, 
\q1 a righteous God and Savior; 
\q2 there is none but Me. 
\b
\q1 
\v 22 Turn to Me and be saved, 
\q2 all the ends of the earth; 
\q1 for I am God, 
\q2 and there is no other. 
\q1 
\v 23 By Myself I have sworn; 
\q2 truth has gone out from My mouth, 
\q2 a word that will not be revoked:

\b
\q1 All who rage against Him 
\q2 will come to Him and be put to shame.

\v 25 In the LORD all descendants of Israel 
\q2 will be justified and will exult.

\s1 Babylon’s Idols
\b
\q1 
\v 1 Bel crouches; Nebo cowers. 
\q2 Their idols weigh down beasts and cattle. 
\q1 The images you carry are burdensome, 
\q2 a load to the weary animal. 
\q1 
\v 2 The gods cower; they crouch together, 
\q2 unable to relieve the burden; 
\q2 but they themselves go into captivity. 
\b
\q1 
\v 3 “Listen to Me, O house of Jacob, 
\q2 all the remnant of the house of Israel, 
\q1 who have been sustained from the womb, 
\q2 carried along since birth. 
\q1 
\v 4 Even to your old age, I will be the same, 
\q2 and I will bear you up when you turn gray. 
\q1 I have made you, and I will carry you; 
\q2 I will sustain you and deliver you. 
\b
\q1 
\v 5 To whom will you liken Me or count Me equal? 
\q2 To whom will you compare Me, that we should be alike? 
\q1 
\v 6 They pour out their bags of gold 
\q2 and weigh out silver on scales; 
\q1 they hire a goldsmith to fashion it into a god, 
\q2 so they can bow down and worship. 
\q1 
\v 7 They lift it to their shoulder 
\q2 and carry it along; 
\q1 they set it in its place, and there it stands, 
\q2 not budging from that spot. 
\q1 They cry out to it, but it does not answer; 
\q2 it saves no one from his troubles. 
\b
\q1 
\v 8 Remember this and be brave; 
\q2 take it to heart, you transgressors! 
\q1 
\v 9 Remember what happened long ago, 
\q2 for I am God, and there is no other; 
\q2 I am God, and there is none like Me. 
\q1 
\v 10 I declare the end from the beginning, 
\q2 and ancient times from what is still to come. 
\q1 I say, ‘My purpose will stand, 
\q2 and all My good pleasure I will accomplish.’ 
\q1 
\v 11 I summon a bird of prey from the east, 
\q2 a man for My purpose from a far-off land. 
\q1 Truly I have spoken, 
\q2 and truly I will bring it to pass. 
\q1 I have planned it, 
\q2 and I will surely do it. 
\b
\q1 
\v 12 Listen to Me, you stubborn people, 
\q2 far removed from righteousness: 
\q1 
\v 13 I am bringing My righteousness near; 
\q2 it is not far away, and My salvation will not be delayed. 
\q1 I will grant salvation to Zion

\s1 The Humiliation of Babylon

\v 1 “Go down and sit in the dust, 
\q2 O Virgin Daughter of Babylon. 
\q1 Sit on the ground without a throne, 
\q2 O Daughter of Chaldea!\f + \fr 47:1 \ft That is, Babylon; also in verse 5\f* 
\q1 For you will no longer be called 
\q2 tender or delicate. 
\q1 
\v 2 Take millstones and grind flour; 
\q2 remove your veil; 
\q1 strip off your skirt, bare your thigh, 
\q2 and wade through the streams. 
\q1 
\v 3 Your nakedness will be uncovered 
\q2 and your shame will be exposed. 
\q1 I will take vengeance; 
\q2 I will spare no one.” 
\b
\q1 
\v 4 Our Redeemer—the LORD of Hosts is His name—
\q2 is the Holy One of Israel. 
\b
\q1 
\v 5 “Sit in silence and go into darkness, 
\q2 O Daughter of Chaldea. 
\q1 For you will no longer be called 
\q2 the queen of kingdoms. 
\q1 
\v 6 I was angry with My people; 
\q2 I profaned My heritage, 
\q2 and I placed them under your control. 
\q1 You showed them no mercy; 
\q2 even on the elderly you laid a most heavy yoke. 
\q1 
\v 7 You said, ‘I will be queen forever.’ 
\q2 You did not take these things to heart 
\q2 or consider their outcome. 
\b
\q1 
\v 8 So now hear this, 
\q2 O lover of luxury who sits securely, 
\q1 who says to herself, 
\q2 ‘I am, and there is none besides me. 
\q1 I will never be a widow 
\q2 or know the loss of children.’ 
\q1 
\v 9 These two things will overtake you in a moment, 
\q2 in a single day: 
\q1 loss of children, and widowhood. 
\q2 They will come upon you in full measure, 
\q1 in spite of your many sorceries 
\q2 and the potency of your spells. 
\q1 
\v 10 You were secure in your wickedness; 
\q2 you said, ‘No one sees me.’ 
\q1 Your wisdom and knowledge led you astray; 
\q2 you told yourself, ‘I am, and there is none besides me.’ 
\q1 
\v 11 But disaster will come upon you; 
\q2 you will not know how to charm it away. 
\q1 A calamity will befall you 
\q2 that you will be unable to ward off. 
\q1 Devastation will happen to you 
\q2 suddenly and unexpectedly. 
\b
\q1 
\v 12 So take your stand with your spells 
\q2 and with your many sorceries, 
\q1 with which you have wearied yourself 
\q2 from your youth. 
\q1 Perhaps you will succeed; 
\q2 perhaps you will inspire terror! 
\q1 
\v 13 You are wearied by your many counselors; 
\q2 let them come forward now and save you—
\q1 your astrologers who observe the stars, 
\q2 who monthly predict your fate. 
\q1 
\v 14 Surely they are like stubble; 
\q2 the fire will burn them up. 
\q1 They cannot deliver themselves 
\q2 from the power of the flame. 
\q1 There will be no coals to warm them 
\q2 or fire to sit beside. 
\q1 
\v 15 This is what they are to you—
\q2 those with whom you have labored and traded from youth—
\q1 each one strays in his own direction; 
\q2 not one of them can save you.

\q1 
\v 1 Listen to Me, O islands;\f + \fr 49:1 \ft Or coastlands\f*

\q1 yet My vindication is with the LORD,

\v 5 And now says the LORD,

\q2 that Israel might be gathered to Him—
\q1 for I am honored in the sight of the LORD,

\q1 Look, you were sold for your iniquities,

\v 2 Why was no one there when I arrived? 
\q2 Why did no one answer when I called? 
\q1 Is My hand too short to redeem you?

\q2 He awakens My ear to listen as a disciple. 
\q1 
\v 5 The Lord GOD has opened My ears,

\q1 
\v 6 I offered My back to those who struck Me, 
\q2 and My cheeks to those who tore out My beard. 
\q2 I did not hide My face from scorn and spittle. 
\q1 
\v 7 Because the Lord GOD helps Me, 
\q2 I have not been disgraced;

\q1 Do not fear the scorn of men; 
\q2 do not be broken by their insults. 
\q1 
\v 8 For the moth will devour them like a garment, 
\q2 and the worm will eat them like wool.

\q2 and forges a weapon fit for its task; 
\q1 and I have created the destroyer 
\q2 to wreak havoc. 
\q1 
\v 17 No weapon formed against you shall prosper, 
\q2 and you will refute every tongue that accuses you. 
\q1 This is the heritage of the servants of the LORD, 
\q2 and their vindication is from Me,”

\s1 Invitation to the Needy
\b
\q1 
\v 1 “Come, all you who are thirsty, 
\q2 come to the waters; 
\q1 and you without money, 
\q2 come, buy, and eat! 
\q1 Come, buy wine and milk 
\q2 without money and without cost! 
\q1 
\v 2 Why spend money on that which is not bread, 
\q2 and your labor on that which does not satisfy? 
\q1 Listen carefully to Me, and eat what is good, 
\q2 and your soul will delight in the richest of foods. 
\b
\q1 
\v 3 Incline your ear and come to Me; 
\q2 listen, so that your soul may live. 
\q1 I will make with you an everlasting covenant—
\q2 My loving devotion promised to David.\f + \fr 55:3 \ft Cited in Acts 13:34\f* 
\q1 
\v 4 Behold, I have made him a witness to the nations, 
\q2 a leader and commander of the peoples. 
\q1 
\v 5 Surely you will summon a nation you do not know, 
\q2 and nations who do not know you will run to you. 
\q1 For the LORD your God, the Holy One of Israel, 
\q2 has bestowed glory on you.” 
\b
\q1 
\v 6 Seek the LORD while He may be found; 
\q2 call on Him while He is near. 
\q1 
\v 7 Let the wicked man forsake his own way 
\q2 and the unrighteous man his own thoughts; 
\q1 let him return to the LORD, 
\q2 that He may have compassion, 
\q1 and to our God, 
\q2 for He will freely pardon. 
\b
\q1 
\v 8 “For My thoughts are not your thoughts, 
\q2 neither are your ways My ways,” 
\qr declares the LORD. 
\q1 
\v 9 “For as the heavens are higher than the earth, 
\q2 so My ways are higher than your ways 
\q2 and My thoughts than your thoughts. 
\q1 
\v 10 For just as rain and snow fall from heaven 
\q2 and do not return without watering the earth, 
\q1 making it bud and sprout, 
\q2 and providing seed to sow and food to eat, 
\q1 
\v 11 so My word that proceeds from My mouth 
\q2 will not return to Me empty, 
\q1 but it will accomplish what I please, 
\q2 and it will prosper where I send it. 
\b
\q1 
\v 12 You will indeed go out with joy 
\q2 and be led forth in peace; 
\q1 the mountains and hills will burst into song before you, 
\q2 and all the trees of the field will clap their hands. 
\q1 
\v 13 Instead of the thornbush, a cypress \f + \fr 55:13 \ft Or pine or juniper or fir\f* will grow, 
\q2 and instead of the brier, a myrtle will spring up; 
\q1 they will make a name for the LORD, 
\q2 an everlasting sign, never to be destroyed.”

\s1 Salvation for Foreigners
\b
\m 
\v 1 This is what the LORD says: 
\b
\q1 “Maintain justice and do what is right, 
\q2 for My salvation is coming soon, 
\q2 and My righteousness will be revealed. 
\q1 
\v 2 Blessed is the man who does this, 
\q2 and the son of man who holds it fast, 
\q1 who keeps the Sabbath without profaning it 
\q2 and keeps his hand from doing any evil.” 
\b
\q1 
\v 3 Let no foreigner who has joined himself to the LORD say, 
\q2 “The LORD will utterly exclude me from His people.” 
\q1 And let the eunuch not say, 
\q2 “I am but a dry tree.” 
\b
\m 
\v 4 For this is what the LORD says: 
\b
\q1 “To the eunuchs who keep My Sabbaths, 
\q2 who choose what pleases Me 
\q2 and hold fast to My covenant—
\q1 
\v 5 I will give them, in My house and within My walls, 
\q2 a memorial and a name 
\q2 better than that of sons and daughters. 
\q1 I will give them an everlasting name 
\q2 that will not be cut off. 
\b
\q1 
\v 6 And the foreigners who join themselves to the LORD 
\q2 to minister to Him, 
\q1 to love the name of the LORD, 
\q2 and to be His servants—
\q1 all who keep the Sabbath without profaning it 
\q2 and who hold fast to My covenant—
\q1 
\v 7 I will bring them to My holy mountain 
\q2 and make them joyful in My house of prayer. 
\q1 Their burnt offerings and sacrifices 
\q2 will be accepted on My altar, 
\q1 for My house will be called a house of prayer \f + \fr 56:7 \ft Cited in Matthew 21:13, Mark 11:17, and Luke 19:46\f* 
\q2 for all the nations.” 
\b
\q1 
\v 8 Thus declares the Lord GOD, 
\q2 who gathers the dispersed of Israel: 
\b
\q1 “I will gather to them still others 
\q2 besides those already gathered.” 
\s1 Israel’s Sinful Leaders
\b
\q1 
\v 9 Come, all you beasts of the field; 
\q2 eat greedily, all you beasts of the forest. 
\q1 
\v 10 Israel’s watchmen are blind, 
\q2 they are all oblivious; 
\q1 they are all mute dogs, 
\q2 they cannot bark; 
\q1 they are dreamers lying around, 
\q2 loving to slumber. 
\q1 
\v 11 Like ravenous dogs, 
\q2 they are never satisfied. 
\q1 They are shepherds with no discernment; 
\q2 they all turn to their own way, 
\q2 each one seeking his own gain: 
\q1 
\v 12 “Come, let me get the wine, 
\q2 let us imbibe the strong drink, 
\q1 and tomorrow will be like today, 
\q2 only far better!” 
\c 57
\s1 The Blessed Death of the Righteous
\b
\q1 
\v 1 The righteous perish, 
\q2 and no one takes it to heart; 
\q1 devout men are swept away, 
\q2 while no one considers 
\q1 that the righteous are guided 
\q2 from the presence of evil. 
\b
\q1 
\v 2 Those who walk uprightly enter into peace; 
\q2 they find rest, lying down in death. 
\s1 God Condemns Idolatry
\b
\q1 
\v 3 “But come here, you sons of a sorceress, 
\q2 you offspring of adulterers and prostitutes! 
\q1 
\v 4 Whom are you mocking? 
\q2 At whom do you snarl and stick out your tongue? 
\q1 Are you not children of transgression, 
\q2 offspring of deceit, 
\q1 
\v 5 who burn with lust among the oaks, 
\q2 under every luxuriant tree, 
\q1 who slaughter your children in the valleys, 
\q2 under the clefts of the rocks? 
\q1 
\v 6 Your portion is among the smooth stones of the valley; 
\q2 indeed, they are your lot. 
\q1 Even to them you have poured out a drink offering 
\q2 and offered a grain offering. 
\q2 Should I relent because of these? 
\b
\q1 
\v 7 On a high and lofty hill you have made your bed, 
\q2 and there you went up to offer sacrifices. 
\q1 
\v 8 Behind the door and doorpost 
\q2 you have set up your memorial. 
\q1 Forsaking Me, you uncovered your bed; 
\q2 you climbed up and opened it wide. 
\q1 And you have made a pact with those whose bed you have loved; 
\q2 you have gazed upon their nakedness. 
\q1 
\v 9 You went to Molech \f + \fr 57:9 \ft Or to the king\f* with oil 
\q2 and multiplied your perfumes. 
\q1 You have sent your envoys \f + \fr 57:9 \ft Or idols\f* a great distance; 
\q2 you have descended even to Sheol itself. 
\q1 
\v 10 You are wearied by your many journeys, 
\q2 but you did not say, “There is no hope!” 
\q1 You found renewal of your strength; 
\q2 therefore you did not grow weak. 
\b
\q1 
\v 11 Whom have you dreaded and feared, 
\q2 so that you lied and failed 
\q2 to remember Me or take this to heart? 
\q1 Is it not because I have long been silent 
\q2 that you do not fear Me? 
\q1 
\v 12 I will expose your righteousness and your works, 
\q2 and they will not profit you. 
\q1 
\v 13 When you cry out, 
\q2 let your companies of idols deliver you! 
\q1 Yet the wind will carry off all of them, 
\q2 a breath will take them away. 
\q1 But he who seeks refuge in Me will inherit the land 
\q2 and possess My holy mountain.” 
\s1 Healing for the Repentant
\b
\m 
\b
\m 
\v 14 And it will be said, 
\b
\q1 “Build it up, build it up, prepare the way, 
\q2 take every obstacle out of the way of My people.” 
\b
\q1 
\v 15 For thus says the One who is high and lifted up, 
\q2 who inhabits eternity, whose name is Holy: 
\b
\q1 “I dwell in a high and holy place, 
\q2 and with the oppressed and humble in spirit, 
\q1 to restore the spirit of the lowly 
\q2 and revive the heart of the contrite. 
\q1 
\v 16 For I will not accuse you forever, 
\q2 nor will I always be angry; 
\q1 for then the spirit of man would grow weak before Me, 
\q2 with the breath of those I have made. 
\b
\q1 
\v 17 I was enraged by his sinful greed, 
\q2 so I struck him and hid My face in anger; 
\q1 yet he kept turning back 
\q2 to the desires of his heart. 
\q1 
\v 18 I have seen his ways, 
\q2 but I will heal him; 
\q1 I will guide him and restore comfort 
\q2 to him and his mourners, 
\q2 
\v 19 bringing praise to their lips. 
\q1 Peace, peace to those far and near,” says the LORD, 
\q2 “and I will heal them.” 
\b
\q1 
\v 20 But the wicked are like the storm-tossed sea, 
\q2 for it cannot be still, 
\q2 and its waves churn up mire and muck. 
\b
\q1 
\v 21 “There is no peace,” says my God, 
\q2 “for the wicked.” 
\c 58
\s1 True Fasts and Sabbaths
\b
\q1 
\v 1 “Cry aloud, do not hold back! 
\q2 Raise your voice like a ram’s horn. 
\q1 Declare to My people their transgression 
\q2 and to the house of Jacob their sins. 
\q1 
\v 2 For day after day they seek Me 
\q2 and delight to know My ways, 
\q1 like a nation that does what is right 
\q2 and does not forsake the justice of their God. 
\q1 They ask Me for righteous judgments; 
\q2 they delight in the nearness of God.” 
\b
\q1 
\v 3 “Why have we fasted, 
\q2 and You have not seen? 
\q1 Why have we humbled ourselves, 
\q2 and You have not noticed?” 
\b
\q1 “Behold, on the day of your fast, you do as you please, 
\q2 and you oppress all your workers. 
\q1 
\v 4 You fast with contention and strife 
\q2 to strike viciously with your fist. 
\q1 You cannot fast as you do today 
\q2 and have your voice be heard on high. 
\b
\q1 
\v 5 Is this the fast I have chosen: 
\q2 a day for a man to deny himself, 
\q1 to bow his head like a reed, 
\q2 and to spread out sackcloth and ashes? 
\q1 Will you call this a fast 
\q2 and a day acceptable to the LORD? 
\b
\q1 
\v 6 Isn’t this the fast that I have chosen: 
\q2 to break the chains of wickedness, 
\q2 to untie the cords of the yoke, 
\q1 to set the oppressed free 
\q2 and tear off every yoke? 
\q1 
\v 7 Isn’t it to share your bread with the hungry, 
\q2 to bring the poor and homeless into your home, 
\q2 to clothe the naked when you see him, 
\q1 and not to turn away 
\q2 from your own flesh and blood? 
\b
\q1 
\v 8 Then your light will break forth like the dawn, 
\q2 and your healing will come quickly. 
\q1 Your righteousness will go before you, 
\q2 and the glory of the LORD will be your rear guard. 
\q1 
\v 9 Then you will call, and the LORD will answer; 
\q2 you will cry out, and He will say, ‘Here I am.’ 
\q1 If you remove the yoke from your midst, 
\q2 the pointing of the finger and malicious talk, 
\q1 
\v 10 and if you give yourself to the hungry 
\q2 and satisfy the afflicted soul, 
\q1 then your light will go forth in the darkness, 
\q2 and your night will be like noonday. 
\q1 
\v 11 The LORD will always guide you; 
\q2 He will satisfy you in a sun-scorched land 
\q2 and strengthen your frame. 
\q1 You will be like a well-watered garden, 
\q2 like a spring whose waters never fail. 
\q1 
\v 12 Your people will rebuild the ancient ruins; 
\q2 you will restore the age-old foundations; 
\q1 you will be called Repairer of the Breach, 
\q2 Restorer of the Streets of Dwelling. 
\b
\q1 
\v 13 If you turn your foot from breaking the Sabbath, 
\q2 from doing as you please on My holy day, 
\q1 if you call the Sabbath a delight, 
\q2 and the LORD’s holy day honorable, 
\q1 if you honor it by not going your own way 
\q2 or seeking your own pleasure or speaking idle words, 
\q1 
\v 14 then you will delight yourself in the LORD, 
\q2 and I will make you ride on the heights of the land 
\q2 and feed you with the heritage of your father Jacob.” 
\qr For the mouth of the LORD has spoken.

\s1 Sin Separates Us from God
\r (Psalm 14:1–7; Psalm 53:1–6; Romans 3:9–20)
\b
\q1 
\v 1 Surely the arm of the LORD is not too short to save, 
\q2 nor His ear too dull to hear. 
\q1 
\v 2 But your iniquities have built barriers 
\q2 between you and your God, 
\q1 and your sins have hidden His face from you, 
\q2 so that He does not hear. 
\q1 
\v 3 For your hands are stained with blood, 
\q2 and your fingers with iniquity; 
\q1 your lips have spoken lies, 
\q2 and your tongue mutters injustice. 
\b
\q1 
\v 4 No one calls for justice; 
\q2 no one pleads his case honestly. 
\q1 They rely on empty pleas; they tell lies; 
\q2 they conceive mischief and give birth to iniquity. 
\q1 
\v 5 They hatch the eggs of vipers 
\q2 and weave a spider’s web. 
\q1 Whoever eats their eggs will die; 
\q2 crack one open, and a viper is hatched. 
\q1 
\v 6 Their cobwebs cannot be made into clothing, 
\q2 and they cannot cover themselves with their works. 
\q1 Their deeds are sinful deeds, 
\q2 and acts of violence are in their hands. 
\b
\q1 
\v 7 Their feet run to evil; 
\q2 they are swift to shed innocent blood. 
\q1 Their thoughts are sinful thoughts; 
\q2 ruin and destruction \f + \fr 59:7 \ft LXX misery\f* lie in their wake. 
\q1 
\v 8 The way of peace they have not known,\f + \fr 59:8 \ft Cited in Romans 3:15–17\f* 
\q2 and there is no justice in their tracks. 
\q1 They have turned them into crooked paths; 
\q2 no one who treads on them will know peace. 
\b
\q1 
\v 9 Therefore justice is far from us, 
\q2 and righteousness does not reach us. 
\q1 We hope for light, but there is darkness; 
\q2 for brightness, but we walk in gloom. 
\q1 
\v 10 Like the blind, we feel our way along the wall, 
\q2 groping like those without eyes. 
\q1 We stumble at midday as in the twilight; 
\q2 among the vigorous we are like the dead. 
\q1 
\v 11 We all growl like bears 
\q2 and moan like doves. 
\q1 We hope for justice, but find none, 
\q2 for salvation, but it is far from us. 
\b
\q1 
\v 12 For our transgressions are multiplied before You, 
\q2 and our sins testify against us. 
\q1 Our transgressions are indeed with us, 
\q2 and we know our iniquities: 
\q1 
\v 13 rebelling and denying the LORD, 
\q2 turning away from our God, 
\q1 speaking oppression and revolt, 
\q2 conceiving and uttering lies from the heart. 
\q1 
\v 14 So justice is turned away, 
\q2 and righteousness stands at a distance. 
\q1 For truth has stumbled in the public square, 
\q2 and honesty cannot enter. 
\q1 
\v 15 Truth is missing, 
\q2 and whoever turns from evil becomes prey. 
\b
\q1 The LORD looked and was displeased \f + \fr 59:15 \ft Hebrew and it was evil in His eyes\f* 
\q2 that there was no justice. 
\q1 
\v 16 He saw that there was no man; 
\q2 He was amazed that there was no one to intercede. 
\q1 So His own arm brought salvation, 
\q2 and His own righteousness sustained Him. 
\q1 
\v 17 He put on righteousness like a breastplate, 
\q2 and the helmet of salvation on His head; 
\q1 He put on garments of vengeance 
\q2 and wrapped Himself in a cloak of zeal. 
\s1 The Covenant of the Redeemer
\b
\q1 
\v 18 So He will repay according to their deeds: 
\q2 fury to His enemies, 
\q2 retribution to His foes, 
\q2 and recompense to the islands.\f + \fr 59:18 \ft Or coastlands\f* 
\q1 
\v 19 So shall they fear the name of the LORD 
\q2 where the sun sets, 
\q2 and His glory where it rises. 
\q1 For He will come like a raging flood, 
\q2 driven by the breath of the LORD.\f + \fr 59:19 \ft Or When the enemy comes like a raging flood, the Spirit of the LORD will drive him back\f* 
\b
\q1 
\v 20 “The Redeemer will come to Zion, 
\q2 to those in Jacob who turn from transgression,\f + \fr 59:20 \ft LXX to remove godlessness from Jacob; cited in Romans 11:26\f*” 
\qr declares the LORD. 
\b
\m 
\v 21 “As for Me, this is My covenant with them,”\f + \fr 59:21 \ft Cited in Romans 11:27\f* says the LORD. “My Spirit will not depart from you,\f + \fr 59:21 \ft Literally My Spirit, who is upon you,\f* and My words that I have put in your mouth will not depart from your mouth or from the mouths of your children and grandchildren, from now on and forevermore,” says the LORD.

\q2 and your daughters will be carried on the arm. 
\q1 
\v 5 Then you will look and be radiant, 
\q2 and your heart will tremble and swell with joy, 
\q1 because the riches of the sea will be brought to you, 
\q2 and the wealth of the nations will come to you. 
\q1 
\v 6 Caravans of camels will cover your land, 
\q2 young camels of Midian and Ephah, 
\q1 and all from Sheba will come, 
\q2 bearing gold and frankincense 
\q2 and proclaiming the praises of the LORD. 
\q1

\q2 I will adorn My glorious house. 
\b
\q1 
\v 8 Who are these who fly like clouds, 
\q2 like doves to their shelters? 
\q1 
\v 9 Surely the islands \f + \fr 60:9 \ft Or coastlands\f* will wait for Me, 
\q2 with the ships of Tarshish \f + \fr 60:9 \ft Or a fleet of trading ships\f* in the lead, 
\q1 to bring your children from afar, 
\q2 with their silver and gold, 
\q1 to the honor of the LORD your God,

\q1 
\v 10 Foreigners will rebuild your walls,

\q2 yet in favor I will show you mercy. 
\q1 
\v 11 Your gates will always stand open; 
\q2 they will never be shut, day or night, 
\q1 so that the wealth of the nations may be brought into you, 
\q2 with their kings being led in procession. 
\q1 
\v 12 For the nation or kingdom that will not serve you will perish; 
\q2 it will be utterly destroyed. 
\b
\q1 
\v 13 The glory of Lebanon will come to you—
\q2 its cypress,\f + \fr 60:13 \ft Or pine or juniper or fir\f* elm, and boxwood together—
\q1 to adorn the place of My sanctuary, 
\q2 and I will glorify the place of My feet. 
\q1 
\v 14 The sons of your oppressors 
\q2 will come and bow down to you; 
\q1 all who reviled you 
\q2 will fall facedown at your feet 
\q1 and call you the City of the LORD, 
\q2 Zion of the Holy One of Israel. 
\b
\q1 
\v 15 Whereas you have been forsaken and despised, 
\q2 with no one passing through, 
\q1 I will make you an everlasting pride, 
\q2 a joy from age to age. 
\q1 
\v 16 You will drink the milk of nations 
\q2 and nurse at the breasts of royalty; 
\q1 you will know that I, the LORD, am your Savior 
\q2 and your Redeemer, the Mighty One of Jacob. 
\b
\q1 
\v 17 Instead of bronze I will bring you gold; 
\q2 I will bring silver in place of iron,

\q1 I will appoint peace as your governor 
\q2 and righteousness as your ruler.

\v 18 No longer will violence be heard in your land,

\q1 But you will name your walls Salvation

\v 21 Then all your people will be righteous;

\q1 
\v 22 The least of you will become a thousand,

\s1 The Year of the LORD’s Favor
\r (Luke 4:16–30)
\b
\q1 
\v 1 The Spirit of the Lord GOD is on Me, 
\q2 because the LORD has anointed Me

\q1 He has sent Me to bind up the brokenhearted, 
\q2 to proclaim liberty to the captives

\v 3 to console the mourners in Zion—
\q2 to give them a crown of beauty for ashes, 
\q1 the oil of joy for mourning, 
\q2 and a garment of praise for a spirit of despair. 
\q1 So they will be called oaks of righteousness, 
\q2 the planting of the LORD, that He may be glorified. 
\b
\q1 
\v 4 They will rebuild the ancient ruins; 
\q2 they will restore the places long devastated; 
\q1 they will renew the ruined cities, 
\q2 the desolations of many generations. 
\q1 
\v 5 Strangers will stand and feed your flocks, 
\q2 and foreigners will be your plowmen and vinedressers. 
\q1 
\v 6 But you will be called the priests of the LORD; 
\q2 they will speak of you as ministers of our God; 
\q1 you will feed on the wealth of nations, 
\q2 and you will boast in their riches. 
\q1 
\v 7 Instead of shame, My people will have a double portion, 
\q2 and instead of humiliation, they will rejoice in their share; 
\q1 and so they will inherit a double portion in their land, 
\q2 and everlasting joy will be theirs. 
\b
\q1 
\v 8 For I, the LORD, love justice; 
\q2 I hate robbery and iniquity; 
\q1 in My faithfulness I will give them their recompense 
\q2 and make an everlasting covenant with them. 
\q1 
\v 9 Their descendants will be known among the nations, 
\q2 and their offspring among the peoples. 
\q1 All who see them will acknowledge 
\q2 that they are a people the LORD has blessed. 
\b
\q1 
\v 10 I will rejoice greatly in the LORD, 
\q2 my soul will exult in my God; 
\q1 for He has clothed me with garments of salvation 
\q2 and wrapped me in a robe of righteousness, 
\q1 as a bridegroom wears a priestly headdress, 
\q2 as a bride adorns herself with her jewels. 
\q1 
\v 11 For as the earth brings forth its growth, 
\q2 and as a garden enables seed to spring up, 
\q1 so the Lord GOD will cause righteousness and praise 
\q2 to spring up before all the nations.

\s1 Zion’s Salvation and New Name
\b
\q1 
\v 1 For Zion’s sake I will not keep silent, 
\q2 and for Jerusalem’s sake I will not keep still, 
\q1 until her righteousness shines like a bright light, 
\q2 her salvation like a blazing torch. 
\q1 
\v 2 Nations will see your righteousness, 
\q2 and all kings your glory. 
\q1 You will be called by a new name 
\q2 that the mouth of the LORD will bestow. 
\q1 
\v 3 You will be a crown of glory in the hand of the LORD, 
\q2 a royal diadem in the palm of your God. 
\q1 
\v 4 No longer will you be called Forsaken,\f + \fr 62:4 \ft Hebrew Azubah\f* 
\q2 nor your land named Desolate;\f + \fr 62:4 \ft Hebrew Shemamah\f* 
\q1 but you will be called Hephzibah,\f + \fr 62:4 \ft Hephzibah means My delight is in her.\f* 
\q2 and your land Beulah;\f + \fr 62:4 \ft Beulah means married.\f* 
\q1 for the LORD will take delight in you, 
\q2 and your land will be His bride. 
\q1 
\v 5 For as a young man marries a young woman, 
\q2 so your sons will marry you; 
\q1 and as a bridegroom rejoices over his bride, 
\q2 so your God will rejoice over you. 
\b
\q1 
\v 6 On your walls, O Jerusalem, I have posted watchmen; 
\q2 they will never be silent day or night. 
\q1 You who call on the LORD 
\q2 shall take no rest for yourselves, 
\q1 
\v 7 nor give Him any rest 
\q2 until He establishes Jerusalem 
\q2 and makes her the praise of the earth. 
\b
\q1 
\v 8 The LORD has sworn by His right hand 
\q2 and by His mighty arm: 
\q1 “Never again will I give your grain 
\q2 to your enemies for food, 
\q1 nor will foreigners drink the new wine 
\q2 for which you have toiled. 
\q1 
\v 9 For those who harvest grain 
\q2 will eat it and praise the LORD, 
\q1 and those who gather grapes 
\q2 will drink the wine in My holy courts.” 
\b
\q1 
\v 10 Go out, go out through the gates; 
\q2 prepare the way for the people! 
\q1 Build it up, build up the highway; 
\q2 clear away the stones; 
\q2 raise a banner for the nations! 
\b
\q1 
\v 11 Behold, the LORD has proclaimed 
\q2 to the ends of the earth, 
\q1 “Say to Daughter Zion: 
\q2 See, your Savior comes! 
\q1 Look, His reward is with Him, 
\q2 and His recompense goes before Him.” 
\b
\q1 
\v 12 And they will be called the Holy People, 
\q2 the Redeemed of The LORD; 
\q1 and you will be called Sought Out, 
\q2 A City Not Forsaken.

\s1 God’s Vengeance on the Nations
\b
\q1 
\v 1 Who is this coming from Edom, 
\q2 from Bozrah with crimson-stained garments? 
\q1 Who is this robed in splendor, 
\q2 marching in the greatness of His strength? 
\b
\q1 “It is I, proclaiming vindication,\f + \fr 63:1 \ft Or It is I, speaking in righteousness,\f* 
\q2 mighty to save.” 
\b
\q1 
\v 2 Why are Your clothes red, 
\q2 and Your garments like one who treads the winepress? 
\b
\q1 
\v 3 “I have trodden the winepress alone, 
\q2 and no one from the nations was with Me. 
\q1 I trampled them in My anger 
\q2 and trod them down in My fury; 
\q1 their blood spattered My garments, 
\q2 and all My clothes were stained. 
\q1 
\v 4 For the day of vengeance was in My heart, 
\q2 and the year of My redemption had come. 
\q1 
\v 5 I looked, but there was no one to help; 
\q2 I was appalled that no one assisted. 
\q1 So My arm brought Me salvation, 
\q2 and My own wrath upheld Me. 
\q1 
\v 6 I trampled the nations in My anger; 
\q2 in My wrath I made them drunk 
\q2 and poured out their blood on the ground.” 
\s1 God’s Mercies Recalled
\b
\q1 
\v 7 I will make known the LORD’s loving devotion 
\q2 and His praiseworthy acts, 
\q1 because of all that the LORD has done for us—
\q2 the many good things for the house of Israel 
\q2 according to His great compassion and loving devotion. 
\b
\q1 
\v 8 For He said, “They are surely My people, 
\q2 sons who will not be disloyal.” 
\q2 So He became their Savior. 
\q1 
\v 9 In all their distress, He too was afflicted, 
\q2 and the Angel of His Presence \f + \fr 63:9 \ft Or angel of His presence\f* saved them. 
\q1 In His love and compassion He redeemed them; 
\q2 He lifted them up and carried them 
\q2 all the days of old. 
\b
\q1 
\v 10 But they rebelled 
\q2 and grieved His Holy Spirit. 
\q1 So He turned and became their enemy, 
\q2 and He Himself fought against them. 
\b
\q1 
\v 11 Then His people remembered the days of old, 
\q2 the days of Moses. 
\q1 Where is He who brought them through the sea 
\q2 with the shepherds of His flock? 
\q1 Where is the One who set 
\q2 His Holy Spirit among them, 
\q1 
\v 12 who sent His glorious arm 
\q2 to lead them by the right hand of Moses, 
\q1 who divided the waters before them 
\q2 to gain for Himself everlasting renown, 
\q1 
\v 13 who led them through the depths 
\q2 like a horse in the wilderness, 
\q2 so that they did not stumble? 
\q1 
\v 14 Like cattle going down to the valley, 
\q2 the Spirit of the LORD gave them rest. 
\q1 You led Your people this way 
\q2 to make for Yourself a glorious name. 
\s1 A Prayer for Mercy
\r (Jeremiah 14:19–22)
\b
\q1 
\v 15 Look down from heaven and see, 
\q2 from Your holy and glorious habitation. 
\q1 Where are Your zeal and might? 
\q2 Your yearning and compassion for me are restrained. 
\q1 
\v 16 Yet You are our Father, 
\q2 though Abraham does not know us 
\q2 and Israel does not acknowledge us. 
\q1 You, O LORD, are our Father; 
\q2 our Redeemer from Everlasting is Your name. 
\b
\q1 
\v 17 Why, O LORD, do You make us stray from Your ways 
\q2 and harden our hearts from fearing You? 
\q1 Return, for the sake of Your servants, 
\q2 the tribes of Your heritage. 
\q1 
\v 18 For a short while Your people possessed Your holy place, 
\q2 but our enemies have trampled Your sanctuary. 
\q1 
\v 19 We have become like those You never ruled, 
\q2 like those not called by Your name. 
\c 64
\s1 A Prayer for God’s Power
\b
\q1 
\v 1 If only You would rend the heavens and come down, 
\q2 so that mountains would quake at Your presence, 
\q1 
\v 2 as fire kindles the brushwood 
\q2 and causes the water to boil, 
\q1 to make Your name known to Your enemies, 
\q2 so that the nations will tremble at Your presence! 
\b
\q1 
\v 3 When You did awesome works that we did not expect, 
\q2 You came down, and the mountains trembled at Your presence. 
\q1 
\v 4 From ancient times no one has heard, 
\q2 no ear has perceived, 
\q1 no eye has seen any God besides You, 
\q2 who acts on behalf of those who wait for Him.\f + \fr 64:4 \ft Cited in 1 Corinthians 2:9\f* 
\b
\q1 
\v 5 You welcome those who gladly do right, 
\q2 who remember Your ways. 
\q1 Surely You were angry, for we sinned. 
\q2 How can we be saved if we remain in our sins? 
\q1 
\v 6 Each of us has become like something unclean, 
\q2 and all our righteous acts are like filthy rags;\f + \fr 64:6 \ft Or like a stained menstrual garment \f* 
\q1 we all wither like a leaf, 
\q2 and our iniquities carry us away like the wind. 
\q1 
\v 7 No one calls on Your name 
\q2 or strives to take hold of You. 
\q1 For You have hidden Your face from us 
\q2 and delivered us into the hand \f + \fr 64:7 \ft LXX, Syriac, and Targum Yonaton; MT have made us melt in the hand\f* of our iniquity. 
\b
\q1 
\v 8 But now, O LORD, You are our Father; 
\q2 we are the clay, and You are the potter; 
\q2 we are all the work of Your hand. 
\q1 
\v 9 Do not be angry, O LORD, beyond measure; 
\q2 do not remember our iniquity forever. 
\q1 Oh, look upon us, we pray; 
\q2 we are all Your people! 
\q1 
\v 10 Your holy cities have become a wilderness. 
\q2 Zion has become a wasteland and Jerusalem a desolation. 
\q1 
\v 11 Our holy and beautiful temple, 
\q2 where our fathers praised You, 
\q1 has been burned with fire, 
\q2 and all that was dear to us lies in ruins. 
\q1 
\v 12 After all this, O LORD, 
\q2 will You restrain Yourself? 
\q1 Will You keep silent 
\q2 and afflict us beyond measure?

\s1 Judgments and Promises
\r (Romans 10:1–21)
\b
\q1 
\v 1 “I revealed Myself to those who did not ask for Me; 
\q2 I was found by those who did not seek Me.\f + \fr 65:1 \ft Cited in Romans 10:20\f* 
\q1 To a nation that did not call My name, 
\q2 I said, ‘Here I am! Here I am!’ 
\q1 
\v 2 All day long I have held out My hands 
\q2 to an obstinate people \f + \fr 65:2 \ft LXX to a disobedient and obstinate people; cited in Romans 10:21\f* 
\q1 who walk in the wrong path, 
\q2 who follow their own imaginations, 
\q1 
\v 3 to a people who continually provoke Me to My face, 
\q2 sacrificing in the gardens 
\q2 and burning incense on altars of brick, 
\q1 
\v 4 sitting among the graves, 
\q2 spending nights in secret places, 
\q1 eating the meat of pigs 
\q2 and polluted broth from their bowls. 
\q1 
\v 5 They say, ‘Keep to yourself; 
\q2 do not come near me, for I am holier than you!’ 
\q1 Such people are smoke in My nostrils, 
\q2 a fire that burns all day long. 
\q1 
\v 6 Behold, it is written before Me: 
\q2 I will not keep silent, but I will repay; 
\q2 I will pay it back into their laps, 
\q1 
\v 7 both for your iniquities 
\q2 and for those of your fathers,” 
\qr says the LORD. 
\q1 “Because they burned incense on the mountains 
\q2 and scorned Me on the hills, 
\q1 I will measure into their laps 
\q2 full payment for their former deeds.” 
\b
\m 
\v 8 This is what the LORD says: 
\b
\q1 “As the new wine is found in a cluster of grapes, 
\q2 and men say, ‘Do not destroy it, for it contains a blessing,’ 
\q1 so I will act on behalf of My servants; 
\q2 I will not destroy them all. 
\q1 
\v 9 And I will bring forth descendants from Jacob, 
\q2 and heirs from Judah; 
\q1 My elect will possess My mountains,\f + \fr 65:9 \ft Or and heirs to My mountains out of Judah; My elect will possess them\f* 
\q2 and My servants will dwell there. 
\q1 
\v 10 Sharon will become a pasture for flocks, 
\q2 and the Valley of Achor a resting place for herds, 
\q2 for My people who seek Me. 
\b
\q1 
\v 11 But you who forsake the LORD, 
\q2 who forget My holy mountain, 
\q1 who set a table for Fortune \f + \fr 65:11 \ft Hebrew Gad, the Babylonian god of fortune\f* 
\q2 and fill bowls of mixed wine for Destiny,\f + \fr 65:11 \ft Hebrew Meni, the Babylonian god of fate\f* 
\q1 
\v 12 I will destine you for the sword, 
\q2 and you will all kneel down to be slaughtered, 
\q1 because I called and you did not answer, 
\q2 I spoke and you did not listen; 
\q1 you did evil in My sight 
\q2 and chose that in which I did not delight.” 
\b
\m 
\v 13 Therefore this is what the Lord GOD says: 
\b
\q1 “My servants will eat, 
\q2 but you will go hungry; 
\q1 My servants will drink, 
\q2 but you will go thirsty; 
\q1 My servants will rejoice, 
\q2 but you will be put to shame. 
\q1 
\v 14 My servants will shout for joy with a glad heart, 
\q2 but you will cry out with a heavy heart 
\q2 and wail with a broken spirit. 
\b
\q1 
\v 15 You will leave behind your name 
\q2 as a curse for My chosen ones, 
\q1 and the Lord GOD will slay you; 
\q2 but to His servants He will give another name. 
\q1 
\v 16 Whoever invokes a blessing in the land 
\q2 will do so by the God of truth, 
\q1 and whoever takes an oath in the land 
\q2 will swear by the God of truth. 
\q1 For the former troubles will be forgotten 
\q2 and hidden from My sight. 
\s1 A New Heaven and a New Earth
\r (Revelation 21:1–8)

\q1 The former things will not be remembered,

\q1 
\v 18 But be glad and rejoice forever 
\q2 in what I create; 
\q1 for I will create Jerusalem to be a joy 
\q2 and its people to be a delight. 
\q1 
\v 19 I will rejoice in Jerusalem 
\q2 and take delight in My people. 
\q1 The sounds of weeping and crying 
\q2 will no longer be heard in her. 
\b
\q1 
\v 20 No longer will a nursing infant live but a few days, 
\q2 or an old man fail to live out his years. 
\q1 For the youth will die at a hundred years, 
\q2 and he who fails to reach a hundred 
\q2 will be considered accursed. 
\q1 
\v 21 They will build houses and dwell in them; 
\q2 they will plant vineyards and eat their fruit. 
\b
\q1 
\v 22 No longer will they build houses for others to inhabit, 
\q2 nor plant for others to eat. 
\q1 For as is the lifetime of a tree, 
\q2 so will be the days of My people, 
\q1 and My chosen ones will fully enjoy 
\q2 the work of their hands. 
\b
\q1 
\v 23 They will not labor in vain 
\q2 or bear children doomed to disaster; 
\q1 for they will be a people blessed by the LORD—
\q2 they and their descendants with them. 
\q1 
\v 24 Even before they call, I will answer, 
\q2 and while they are still speaking, I will hear. 
\b
\q1

\q2 and the lion will eat straw like the ox, 
\q1 but the food of the serpent \f + \fr 65:25 \ft Hebrew nachash; translated in most cases as snake\f* will be dust.

\q1 
\v 2 Has not My hand made all these things?\f + \fr 66:2 \ft Cited in Acts 7:49–50\f*

\q1 “This is the one I will esteem:

\q2 who trembles at My word. 
\b
\q1 
\v 3 Whoever slaughters an ox is like one who slays a man; 
\q2 whoever sacrifices a lamb is like one who breaks a dog’s neck; 
\q1 whoever presents a grain offering is like one who offers pig’s blood; 
\q2 whoever offers frankincense is like one who blesses an idol. 
\q1 Indeed, they have chosen their own ways 
\q2 and delighted in their abominations. 
\q1 
\v 4 So I will choose their punishment 
\q2 and I will bring terror upon them, 
\q1 because I called and no one answered, 
\q2 I spoke and no one listened. 
\q1 But they did evil in My sight 
\q2 and chose that in which I did not delight.” 
\b
\q1 
\v 5 You who tremble at His word, 
\q2 hear the word of the LORD: 
\b
\q1 “Your brothers who hate you 
\q2 and exclude you because of My name 
\q1 have said, ‘Let the LORD be glorified 
\q2 that we may see your joy!’ 
\q2 But they will be put to shame.” 
\b
\q1 
\v 6 Hear the uproar from the city;

\q2 repaying His enemies what they deserve! 
\s1 Rejoice with Jerusalem
\b
\q1 
\v 7 “Before she was in labor, she gave birth;

\v 8 Who has heard of such as this? 
\q2 Who has seen such things?

\q1 Rejoice greatly with her,

\v 11 so that you may nurse and be satisfied 
\q2 at her comforting breasts;

\q1 “I will extend peace to her like a river,

\q1 you will nurse and be carried on her arm, 
\q2 and bounced upon her knees. 
\q1 
\v 13 As a mother comforts her son, 
\q2 so will I comfort you, 
\q2 and you will be consoled over Jerusalem.” 
\b
\q1 
\v 14 When you see, you will rejoice, 
\q2 and you will flourish like grass;
