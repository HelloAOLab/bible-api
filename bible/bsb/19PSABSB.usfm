\s1 The Two Paths
\r (Matthew 5:3–12; Luke 6:20–23)
\b
\q1 Blessed is the man 
\q2 who does not walk in the counsel of the wicked, 
\q1 or set foot on the path of sinners, 
\q2 or sit in the seat of mockers. 
\q1 
\v 2 But his delight is in the Law of the LORD, 
\q2 and on His law he meditates day and night. 
\q1 
\v 3 He is like a tree planted by streams of water, 
\q2 yielding its fruit in season, 
\q1 whose leaf does not wither, 
\q2 and who prospers in all he does. 
\b
\q1 
\v 4 Not so the wicked! 
\q2 For they are like chaff driven off by the wind. 
\q1 
\v 5 Therefore the wicked will not stand in the judgment, 
\q2 nor sinners in the assembly of the righteous. 
\b
\q1 
\v 6 For the LORD guards the path of the righteous, 
\q2 but the way of the wicked will perish.

\s1 The Triumphant Messiah
\r (Acts 4:23–31)
\b
\q1 Why do the nations rage \f + \fr 2:1 \ft Or noisily assemble; see Revelation 11:18.\f* 
\q2 and the peoples plot in vain?

\q2 and the rulers gather together, 
\q1 against the LORD 
\q2 and against His Anointed One:\f + \fr 2:2 \ft Cited in Acts 4:25–26\f* 
\q1 
\v 3 “Let us break Their chains 
\q2 and cast away Their cords.” 
\b
\q1 
\v 4 The One enthroned in heaven laughs; 
\q2 the Lord taunts them. 
\q1 
\v 5 Then He rebukes them in His anger, 
\q2 and terrifies them in His fury: 
\q1 
\v 6 “I have installed My King on Zion, 
\q2 upon My holy mountain.” 
\b
\q1 
\v 7 I will proclaim the decree 
\q2 spoken to Me by the LORD: 
\q1 “You are My Son; 
\q2 today I have become Your Father.\f + \fr 2:7 \ft Literally today I have begotten You; cited in Acts 13:33, Hebrews 1:5, and Hebrews 5:5\f*

\q2 the ends of the earth Your possession. 
\q1 
\v 9 You will break them \f + \fr 2:9 \ft LXX You will rule them or You will shepherd them\f* with an iron scepter; 
\q2 You will shatter them like pottery.\f + \fr 2:9 \ft Cited in Revelation 2:27; see also Revelation 12:5 and Revelation 19:15.\f*” 
\b
\q1

\q2 be admonished, O judges of the earth. 
\q1 
\v 11 Serve the LORD with fear, 
\q2 and rejoice with trembling. 
\q1 
\v 12 Kiss the Son, lest He be angry 
\q2 and you perish in your rebellion, 
\q2 when His wrath ignites in an instant. 
\b
\q1 Blessed are all who take refuge in Him.

\v 3 In the morning, O LORD, You hear my voice; 
\q2 at daybreak I lay my plea before You

\b
\q1 
\v 4 For You are not a God who delights in wickedness; 
\q2 no evil can dwell with You. 
\q1 
\v 5 The boastful cannot stand in Your presence; 
\q2 You hate all workers of iniquity. 
\q1 
\v 6 You destroy those who tell lies; 
\q2 the LORD abhors the man of bloodshed and deceit. 
\b
\q1 
\v 7 But I will enter Your house 
\q2 by the abundance of Your loving devotion;\f + \fr 5:7 \ft Forms of the Hebrew chesed are translated here and in most cases throughout the Scriptures as loving devotion; the range of meaning includes love, goodness, kindness, faithfulness, and mercy, as well as loyalty to a covenant.\f*

\b
\q1 
\v 8 Lead me, O LORD, in Your righteousness 
\q2 because of my enemies; 
\q2 make straight Your way before me. 
\q1

\q2 their tongues practice deceit.\f + \fr 5:9 \ft Or flattery; cited in Romans 3:13\f* 
\b

\q2 for they have rebelled against You. 
\b
\q1 
\v 11 But let all who take refuge in You rejoice; 
\q2 let them ever shout for joy. 
\q1 May You shelter them, 
\q2 that those who love Your name may rejoice in You.

\v 12 For surely You, O LORD, bless the righteous;

\q1 
\v 3 My soul is deeply distressed. 
\q2 How long, O LORD, how long? 
\b
\q1 
\v 4 Turn, O LORD, and deliver my soul; 
\q2 save me because of Your loving devotion. 
\q1 
\v 5 For there is no mention of You in death; 
\q2 who can praise You from Sheol? 
\b
\q1 
\v 6 I am weary from groaning; 
\q2 all night I flood my bed with weeping 
\q2 and drench my couch with tears. 
\q1 
\v 7 My eyes fail from grief; 
\q2 they grow dim because of all my foes. 
\b
\q1 
\v 8 Depart from me, all you workers of iniquity, 
\q2 for the LORD has heard my weeping. 
\q1 
\v 9 The LORD has heard my cry for mercy; 
\q2 the LORD accepts my prayer. 
\q1 
\v 10 All my enemies will be ashamed and dismayed;

\b
\q1 
\v 1 O LORD my God, I take refuge in You;

\q1 
\v 2 or they will shred my soul like a lion 
\q2 and tear me to pieces with no one to rescue me. 
\b
\q1 
\v 3 O LORD my God, if I have done this, 
\q2 if injustice is on my hands, 
\q1 
\v 4 if I have rewarded my ally \f + \fr 7:4 \ft Hebrew the one at peace with me\f* with evil, 
\q2 if I have plundered my foe without cause, 
\q1 
\v 5 then may my enemy pursue me and overtake me; 
\q2 may he trample me to the ground 
\q2 and leave my honor in the dust. 
\qr Selah 
\q1 
\v 6 Arise, O LORD, in Your anger; 
\q2 rise up against the fury of my enemies. 
\q2 Awake, my God, and ordain judgment. 
\q1 
\v 7 Let the assembled peoples gather around You; 
\q2 take Your seat over them on high.

\b
\q1 
\v 10 My shield is with God,

\q1 
\v 11 God is a righteous judge 
\q2 and a God who feels indignation each day. 
\q1 
\v 12 If one does not repent, 
\q2 God will sharpen His sword; 
\q2 He has bent and strung His bow. 
\q1 
\v 13 He has prepared His deadly weapons; 
\q2 He ordains His arrows with fire. 
\b
\q1 
\v 14 Behold, the wicked man travails with evil; 
\q2 he conceives trouble and births falsehood. 
\q1 
\v 15 He has dug a hole and hollowed it out; 
\q2 he has fallen into a pit of his own making. 
\q1 
\v 16 His trouble recoils on himself, 
\q2 and his violence falls on his own head. 
\b
\q1 
\v 17 I will thank the LORD for His righteousness 
\q2 and sing praise to the name of the LORD Most High.

\q2 the work of Your fingers, 
\q1 the moon and the stars, 
\q2 which You have set in place—
\b

\q2 I will sing praise to Your name, O Most High. 
\b
\q1 
\v 3 When my enemies retreat, 
\q2 they stumble and perish before You. 
\q1 
\v 4 For You have upheld my just cause; 
\q2 You sit on Your throne judging righteously. 
\q1 
\v 5 You have rebuked the nations; 
\q2 You have destroyed the wicked; 
\q2 You have erased their name forever and ever. 
\q1 
\v 6 The enemy has come to eternal ruin, 
\q2 and You have uprooted their cities; 
\q2 the very memory of them has vanished. 
\b
\q1 
\v 7 But the LORD abides forever; 
\q2 He has established His throne for judgment. 
\q1 
\v 8 He judges the world with justice; 
\q2 He governs the people with equity. 
\q1 
\v 9 The LORD is a refuge for the oppressed,

\b
\q1 
\v 11 Sing praises to the LORD, who dwells in Zion;

\q2 see how my enemies afflict me! 
\q1 Lift me up from the gates of death, 
\q2

\q1 that within the gates of Daughter Zion 
\q2 I may rejoice in Your salvation. 
\b
\q1 
\v 15 The nations have fallen into a pit of their making; 
\q2 their feet are caught in the net they have hidden.

\s1 The Perils of the Pilgrim
\b
\q1 Why, O LORD, do You stand far off? 
\q2 Why do You hide in times of trouble? 
\q1 
\v 2 In pride the wicked pursue the needy; 
\q2 let them be caught in the schemes they devise. 
\b
\q1 
\v 3 For the wicked man boasts in the cravings of his heart; 
\q2 he blesses the greedy and reviles the LORD. 
\q1 
\v 4 In his pride the wicked man does not seek Him; 
\q2 in all his schemes there is no God. 
\q1 
\v 5 He is secure in his ways at all times; 
\q2 Your lofty judgments are far from him; 
\q2 he sneers at all his foes. 
\q1 
\v 6 He says to himself, “I will not be moved; 
\q2 from age to age I am free of distress.” 
\b
\q1 
\v 7 His mouth is full of cursing, deceit,\f + \fr 10:7 \ft LXX bitterness; cited in Romans 3:14\f* and violence; 
\q2 trouble and malice are under his tongue.

\q2 in ambush he slays the innocent; 
\q2 his eyes watch in stealth for the helpless. 
\q1 
\v 9 He lies in wait like a lion in a thicket; 
\q2 he lurks to seize the oppressed; 
\q2 he catches the lowly in his net. 
\q1 
\v 10 They are crushed and beaten down;\f + \fr 10:10 \ft Or He crouches and lies low\f* 
\q2 the hapless fall prey to his strength. 
\q1 
\v 11 He says to himself, “God has forgotten; 
\q2 He hides His face and never sees.” 
\b
\q1 
\v 12 Arise, O LORD! Lift up Your hand, O God! 
\q2 Do not forget the helpless. 
\q1 
\v 13 Why has the wicked man renounced God? 
\q2 He says to himself, “You will never call me to account.” 
\q1 
\v 14 But You have regarded trouble and grief; 
\q2 You see to repay it by Your hand. 
\q1 The victim entrusts himself to You; 
\q2 You are the helper of the fatherless. 
\q1 
\v 15 Break the arm of the wicked and evildoer; 
\q2 call him to account for his wickedness 
\q2 until none is left to be found. 
\b
\q1 
\v 16 The LORD is King forever and ever; 
\q2 the nations perish from His land. 
\q1 
\v 17 You have heard, O LORD, the desire of the humble; 
\q2 You will strengthen their hearts. 
\q1 You will incline Your ear, 
\q2 
\v 18 to vindicate the fatherless and oppressed, 
\q1 that the men of the earth 
\q2 may strike terror no more.

\v 2 For behold, the wicked bend their bows. 
\q1 They set their arrow on the string 
\q2 to shoot from the shadows at the upright in heart. 
\q1 
\v 3 If the foundations are destroyed, 
\q2 what can the righteous do?” 
\b
\q1 
\v 4 The LORD is in His holy temple; 
\q2 the LORD is on His heavenly throne. 
\q1 His eyes are watching closely; 
\q2 they examine the sons of men. 
\q1 
\v 5 The LORD tests the righteous and the wicked;

\q1 
\v 6 On the wicked He will rain down fiery coals and sulfur; 
\q2 a scorching wind will be their portion.

\v 2 They lie to one another;

\q1 
\v 3 May the LORD cut off all flattering lips 
\q2 and every boastful tongue. 
\q1 
\v 4 They say, “With our tongues we will prevail. 
\q2 We own our lips—who can be our master?” 
\b
\q1 
\v 5 “For the cause of the oppressed 
\q2 and for the groaning of the needy, 
\q1 I will now arise,” says the LORD. 
\q2 “I will bring safety to him who yearns.” 
\b
\q1 
\v 6 The words of the LORD are flawless, 
\q2 like silver refined in a furnace, 
\q2 like gold purified sevenfold.\f + \fr 12:6 \ft Probable reading; MT like silver refined in a furnace of clay, purified sevenfold\f* 
\q1

\b
\d For the choirmaster. A Psalm of David.

\b
\q1 
\v 3 Consider me and respond, O LORD my God. 
\q2 Give light to my eyes, lest I sleep in death,

\q2 and my foes rejoice when I fall.

\q1 
\v 5 But I have trusted in Your loving devotion; 
\q2 my heart will rejoice in Your salvation. 
\q1 
\v 6 I will sing to the LORD,

\b
\q1 
\v 1 The fool \f + \fr 14:1 \ft The Hebrew words rendered fool throughout the Psalms denote one who is morally deficient.\f* says in his heart, 
\q2 “There is no God.” 
\b
\q1 They are corrupt; their acts are vile.

\b
\q1 
\v 2 The LORD looks down from heaven

\b
\d For the choirmaster. Of David the servant of the LORD, who sang this song to the LORD on the day the LORD had delivered him from the hand of all his enemies and from the hand of Saul. He said: 
\b
\q1 
\v 1 I love You, O LORD, my strength. 
\b
\q1 
\v 2 The LORD is my rock, my fortress, and my deliverer. 
\q2 My God is my rock, in whom I take refuge,

\q1 
\v 3 I will call upon the LORD, who is worthy to be praised;

\v 5 The cords of Sheol entangled me; 
\q2 the snares of death confronted me. 
\q1 
\v 6 In my distress I called upon the LORD; 
\q2 I cried to my God for help. 
\q1 From His temple He heard my voice, 
\q2 and my cry for His help reached His ears. 
\b
\q1 
\v 7 Then the earth shook and quaked, 
\q2 and the foundations of the mountains trembled; 
\q2 they were shaken because He burned with anger. 
\q1 
\v 8 Smoke rose from His nostrils, 
\q2 and consuming fire came from His mouth; 
\q2 glowing coals blazed forth. 
\q1 
\v 9 He parted the heavens and came down 
\q2 with dark clouds beneath His feet. 
\q1 
\v 10 He mounted a cherub and flew; 
\q2 He soared on the wings of the wind. 
\q1 
\v 11 He made darkness His hiding place, 
\q2 and storm clouds a canopy around Him.

\q1 
\v 14 He shot His arrows and scattered the foes; 
\q2 He hurled lightning and routed them. 
\q1 
\v 15 The channels of the sea appeared, 
\q2 and the foundations of the world were exposed, 
\q1 at Your rebuke, O LORD, 
\q2 at the blast of the breath of Your nostrils. 
\b
\q1 
\v 16 He reached down from on high and took hold of me; 
\q2 He drew me out of deep waters. 
\q1 
\v 17 He rescued me from my powerful enemy, 
\q2 from foes too mighty for me. 
\q1 
\v 18 They confronted me in my day of calamity, 
\q2 but the LORD was my support. 
\q1 
\v 19 He brought me out into the open; 
\q2 He rescued me because He delighted in me. 
\b
\q1 
\v 20 The LORD has rewarded me according to my righteousness; 
\q2 He has repaid me according to the cleanness of my hands. 
\q1 
\v 21 For I have kept the ways of the LORD 
\q2 and have not wickedly departed from my God. 
\q1 
\v 22 For all His ordinances are before me; 
\q2 I have not disregarded His statutes. 
\q1 
\v 23 And I have been blameless before Him

\q2 to the blameless You show Yourself blameless; 
\q1 
\v 26 to the pure You show Yourself pure, 
\q2 but to the crooked You show Yourself shrewd. 
\q1 
\v 27 For You save an afflicted people, 
\q2 but You humble those with haughty eyes. 
\b
\q1 
\v 28 For You, O LORD, light my lamp; 
\q2 my God lights up my darkness. 
\q1

\q2 and with my God I can scale a wall. 
\q1 
\v 30 As for God, His way is perfect; 
\q2 the word of the LORD is flawless. 
\q2 He is a shield to all who take refuge in Him. 
\b
\q1 
\v 31 For who is God besides the LORD? 
\q2 And who is the Rock except our God? 
\q1 
\v 32 It is God who arms me with strength 
\q2 and makes my way clear. 
\q1 
\v 33 He makes my feet like those of a deer 
\q2 and stations me upon the heights. 
\q1 
\v 34 He trains my hands for battle; 
\q2 my arms can bend a bow of bronze.

\q2 I did not turn back until they were consumed. 
\q1 
\v 38 I crushed them so they could not rise; 
\q2 they have fallen under my feet. 
\b
\q1 
\v 39 You have armed me with strength for battle; 
\q2 You have subdued my foes beneath me. 
\q1 
\v 40 You have made my enemies retreat before me; 
\q2 I put an end to those who hated me. 
\q1 
\v 41 They cried for help, but there was no one to save them—
\q2 to the LORD, but He did not answer. 
\q1

\q2 I trampled them \f + \fr 18:42 \ft Some Hebrew manuscripts, LXX, and Syriac (see also 2 Samuel 22:43); MT I poured them out\f* like mud in the streets. 
\b

\q2 You have made me the head of nations; 
\q2 a people I had not known shall serve me. 
\q1 
\v 44 When they hear me, they obey me; 
\q2 foreigners cower before me. 
\q1 
\v 45 Foreigners lose heart 
\q2 and come trembling from their strongholds.

\q1 
\v 46 The LORD lives, and blessed be my Rock! 
\q2 And may the God of my salvation be exalted—
\q1 
\v 47 the God who avenges me 
\q2 and subdues nations beneath me, 
\q2 
\v 48 who delivers me from my enemies. 
\q1 You exalt me above my foes;

\v 49 Therefore I will praise You, O LORD, among the nations; 
\q2 I will sing praises to Your name.\f + \fr 18:49 \ft Cited in Romans 15:9\f*

\q1 Do not let me be put to shame;

\q1 The LORD is the stronghold of my life—

\v 2 When the wicked came upon me to devour my flesh,

\q1 
\v 3 Though an army encamps around me,

\q2 I will keep my trust. 
\b
\q1 
\v 4 One thing I have asked of the LORD;

\q1 
\v 6 Then my head will be held high

\q1 At His tabernacle I will offer sacrifices with shouts of joy;

\b
\q1 
\v 7 Hear, O LORD, my voice when I call;

\q1 
\v 12 Do not hand me over to the will of my foes,

\q2 while malice is in their hearts. 
\q1 
\v 4 Repay them according to their deeds 
\q2 and for their works of evil. 
\q1 Repay them for what their hands have done; 
\q2 bring back on them what they deserve. 
\q1 
\v 5 Since they show no regard for the works of the LORD 
\q2 or what His hands have done, 
\q1 He will tear them down 
\q2 and never rebuild them. 
\b
\q1 
\v 6 Blessed be the LORD,

\s1 Contend with My Opponents, O LORD
\b
\d Of David. 
\b
\q1 
\v 1 Contend with my opponents, O LORD; 
\q2 fight against those who fight against me. 
\q1 
\v 2 Take up Your shield and buckler; 
\q2 arise and come to my aid. 
\q1 
\v 3 Draw the spear and javelin \f + \fr 35:3 \ft Or and close the way\f* against my pursuers; 
\q2 say to my soul: “I am your salvation.” 
\b
\q1 
\v 4 May those who seek my life 
\q2 be disgraced and put to shame; 
\q1 may those who plan to harm me 
\q2 be driven back and confounded. 
\q1 
\v 5 May they be like chaff in the wind, 
\q2 as the angel of the LORD drives them away. 
\q1 
\v 6 May their path be dark and slick, 
\q2 as the angel of the LORD pursues. 
\q1 
\v 7 For without cause they laid their net for me; 
\q2 without reason they dug a pit for my soul. 
\q1 
\v 8 May ruin befall them by surprise; 
\q2 may the net they hid ensnare them; 
\q2 may they fall into the hazard they created. 
\b
\q1 
\v 9 Then my soul will rejoice in the LORD 
\q2 and exult in His salvation. 
\q1 
\v 10 All my bones will exclaim,

\q1 who delivers the afflicted from the aggressor, 
\q2 the poor and needy from the robber?” 
\b
\q1 
\v 11 Hostile witnesses come forward; 
\q2 they make charges I know nothing about. 
\q1 
\v 12 They repay me evil for good, 
\q2 to the bereavement of my soul. 
\q1 
\v 13 Yet when they were ill, 
\q2 I put on sackcloth; 
\q1 I humbled myself with fasting, 
\q2 but my prayers returned unanswered.\f + \fr 35:13 \ft Literally returned to my bosom\f* 
\q1 
\v 14 I paced about 
\q2 as for my friend or brother; 
\q1 I was bowed down with grief, 
\q2 like one mourning for his mother. 
\q1 
\v 15 But when I stumbled, they assembled in glee; 
\q2 they gathered together against me. 
\q1 Assailants I did not know 
\q2 slandered me without ceasing. 
\q1 
\v 16 Like godless jesters at a feast,\f + \fr 35:16 \ft Or Like a godless circle of mockers,\f* 
\q2 they gnashed their teeth at me.

\v 17 How long, O Lord, will You look on? 
\q2 Rescue my soul from their ravages,

\q1 
\v 18 Then I will give You thanks in the great assembly; 
\q2 I will praise You among many people. 
\q1 
\v 19 Let not my enemies gloat over me without cause, 
\q2 nor those who hate me without reason wink in malice.\f + \fr 35:19 \ft See John 15:25.\f* 
\q1 
\v 20 For they do not speak peace, 
\q2 but they devise deceitful schemes 
\q2 against those who live quietly in the land. 
\q1 
\v 21 They gape at me and say, 
\q2 “Aha, aha! Our eyes have seen!” 
\b
\q1 
\v 22 O LORD, You have seen it; be not silent. 
\q2 O Lord, be not far from me. 
\q1 
\v 23 Awake and rise to my defense, 
\q2 to my cause, my God and my Lord! 
\q1 
\v 24 Vindicate me by Your righteousness, O LORD my God, 
\q2 and do not let them gloat over me. 
\q1 
\v 25 Let them not say in their hearts, 
\q2 “Aha, just what we wanted!” 
\q1 Let them not say, 
\q2 “We have swallowed him up!” 
\b
\q1 
\v 26 May those who gloat in my distress 
\q2 be ashamed and confounded; 
\q1 may those who exalt themselves over me 
\q2 be clothed in shame and reproach. 
\q1 
\v 27 May those who favor my vindication

\s1 The Transgression of the Wicked
\b
\d For the choirmaster. A Psalm of David, the servant of the LORD. 
\b
\q1 
\v 1 An oracle is in my heart 
\q2 regarding the transgression of the wicked man: 
\q1 There is no fear of God 
\q2 before his eyes.\f + \fr 36:1 \ft Cited in Romans 3:18\f* 
\q1 
\v 2 For his eyes are too full of conceit 
\q2 to detect or hate his own sin. 
\q1 
\v 3 The words of his mouth are wicked and deceitful; 
\q2 he has ceased to be wise and well-doing. 
\q1 
\v 4 Even on his bed he plots wickedness; 
\q2 he sets himself on a path that is not good; 
\q2 he fails to reject evil. 
\b
\q1 
\v 5 Your loving devotion, O LORD, reaches to the heavens, 
\q2 Your faithfulness to the clouds. 
\q1 
\v 6 Your righteousness is like the highest mountains; 
\q2 Your judgments are like the deepest sea. 
\q2 O LORD, You preserve man and beast. 
\q1 
\v 7 How precious is Your loving devotion, O God, 
\q2 that the children of men take refuge 
\q2 in the shadow of Your wings! 
\q1 
\v 8 They feast on the abundance of Your house, 
\q2 and You give them drink from Your river of delights. 
\q1 
\v 9 For with You is the fountain of life; 
\q2 in Your light we see light. 
\b
\q1 
\v 10 Extend Your loving devotion to those who know You, 
\q2 and Your righteousness to the upright in heart. 
\q1 
\v 11 Let not the foot of the proud come against me, 
\q2 nor the hand of the wicked drive me away. 
\q1 
\v 12 There the evildoers lie fallen, 
\q2 thrown down and unable to rise.

\s1 Delight Yourself in the LORD
\r (1 Kings 2:1–9)
\b
\d Of David.\f + \fr 37:1 \ft This psalm is an acrostic poem, each stanza beginning with the successive letters of the Hebrew alphabet.\f* 
\q1 
\v 1 Do not fret over those who do evil; 
\q2 do not envy those who do wrong. 
\q1 
\v 2 For they wither quickly like grass 
\q2 and wilt like tender plants. 
\b
\q1 
\v 3 Trust in the LORD and do good; 
\q2 dwell in the land and cultivate faithfulness. 
\q1 
\v 4 Delight yourself in the LORD, 
\q2 and He will give you the desires of your heart. 
\b
\q1 
\v 5 Commit your way to the LORD; 
\q2 trust in Him, and He will do it. 
\q1 
\v 6 He will bring forth your righteousness like the dawn, 
\q2 your justice like the noonday sun. 
\b
\q1 
\v 7 Be still before the LORD 
\q2 and wait patiently for Him; 
\q1 do not fret when men prosper in their ways, 
\q2 when they carry out wicked schemes. 
\b
\q1 
\v 8 Refrain from anger and abandon wrath; 
\q2 do not fret—it can only bring harm. 
\q1 
\v 9 For the evildoers will be cut off, 
\q2 but those who hope in the LORD will inherit the land. 
\b
\q1 
\v 10 Yet a little while, and the wicked will be no more; 
\q2 though you look for them, they will not be found. 
\q1 
\v 11 But the meek will inherit the land \f + \fr 37:11 \ft Or the earth; see Matthew 5:5.\f* 
\q2 and delight in abundant prosperity. 
\b
\q1 
\v 12 The wicked scheme against the righteous 
\q2 and gnash their teeth at them, 
\q1 
\v 13 but the Lord laughs, 
\q2 seeing that their day is coming. 
\b
\q1 
\v 14 The wicked have drawn the sword 
\q2 and bent the bow 
\q1 to bring down the poor and needy, 
\q2 to slay those whose ways are upright. 
\q1 
\v 15 But their swords will pierce their own hearts, 
\q2 and their bows will be broken. 
\b
\q1 
\v 16 Better is the little of the righteous 
\q2 than the abundance of many who are wicked. 
\q1 
\v 17 For the arms of the wicked will be broken, 
\q2 but the LORD upholds the righteous. 
\b
\q1 
\v 18 The LORD knows the days of the blameless, 
\q2 and their inheritance will last forever. 
\q1 
\v 19 In the time of evil they will not be ashamed, 
\q2 and in the days of famine they will be satisfied. 
\b
\q1 
\v 20 But the wicked and enemies of the LORD 
\q2 will perish like the glory of the fields. 
\q1 They will vanish; 
\q2 like smoke they will fade away. 
\b
\q1 
\v 21 The wicked borrow and do not repay, 
\q2 but the righteous are gracious and giving. 
\q1 
\v 22 Surely those He blesses will inherit the land, 
\q2 but the cursed will be destroyed. 
\b
\q1 
\v 23 The steps of a man are ordered by the LORD 
\q2 who takes delight in his journey. 
\q1 
\v 24 Though he falls, he will not be overwhelmed, 
\q2 for the LORD is holding his hand.\f + \fr 37:24 \ft Or upholds him with His hand\f* 
\b
\q1 
\v 25 I once was young and now am old, 
\q2 yet never have I seen the righteous abandoned 
\q2 or their children begging for bread. 
\q1 
\v 26 They are ever generous and quick to lend, 
\q2 and their children are a blessing. 
\b
\q1 
\v 27 Turn away from evil and do good, 
\q2 so that you will abide forever. 
\q1 
\v 28 For the LORD loves justice 
\q2 and will not forsake His saints. 
\q1 They are preserved forever, 
\q2 but the offspring of the wicked will be cut off. 
\q1 
\v 29 The righteous will inherit the land 
\q2 and dwell in it forever. 
\b
\q1 
\v 30 The mouth of the righteous man utters wisdom, 
\q2 and his tongue speaks justice. 
\q1 
\v 31 The law of his God is in his heart; 
\q2 his steps do not falter. 
\b
\q1 
\v 32 Though the wicked lie in wait for the righteous, 
\q2 and seek to slay them, 
\q1 
\v 33 the LORD will not leave them in their power 
\q2 or let them be condemned under judgment. 
\b
\q1 
\v 34 Wait for the LORD and keep His way, 
\q2 and He will raise you up to inherit the land. 
\q1 When the wicked are cut off, 
\q2 you will see it. 
\b
\q1 
\v 35 I have seen a wicked, ruthless man 
\q2 flourishing like a well-rooted native tree, 
\q1 
\v 36 yet he passed away and was no more; 
\q2 though I searched, he could not be found. 
\b
\q1 
\v 37 Consider the blameless and observe the upright, 
\q2 for posterity awaits the man of peace.\f + \fr 37:37 \ft Or for there is a future for the man of peace\f* 
\q1 
\v 38 But the transgressors will all be destroyed; 
\q2 the future of the wicked will be cut off. 
\b
\q1 
\v 39 The salvation of the righteous is from the LORD; 
\q2 He is their stronghold in time of trouble. 
\q1 
\v 40 The LORD helps and delivers them; 
\q2 He rescues and saves them from the wicked, 
\q2 because they take refuge in Him.

\s1 Do Not Rebuke Me in Your Anger
\r (Psalm 6:1–10)
\b
\d A Psalm of David, for remembrance. 
\b
\q1 
\v 1 O LORD, do not rebuke me in Your anger 
\q2 or discipline me in Your wrath. 
\q1 
\v 2 For Your arrows have pierced me deeply, 
\q2 and Your hand has pressed down on me. 
\b
\q1 
\v 3 There is no soundness in my body 
\q2 because of Your anger; 
\q1 there is no rest in my bones 
\q2 because of my sin. 
\q1 
\v 4 For my iniquities have overwhelmed me; 
\q2 they are a burden too heavy to bear. 
\q1 
\v 5 My wounds are foul and festering 
\q2 because of my sinful folly. 
\q1 
\v 6 I am bent and brought low; 
\q2 all day long I go about mourning. 
\q1 
\v 7 For my loins are full of burning pain, 
\q2 and no soundness remains in my body. 
\q1 
\v 8 I am numb and badly crushed; 
\q2 I groan in anguish of heart. 
\b
\q1 
\v 9 O Lord, my every desire is before You; 
\q2 my groaning is not hidden from You. 
\q1 
\v 10 My heart pounds, my strength fails, 
\q2 and even the light of my eyes has faded. 
\q1 
\v 11 My beloved and friends shun my disease, 
\q2 and my kinsmen stand at a distance. 
\q1 
\v 12 Those who seek my life lay snares; 
\q2 those who wish me harm speak destruction, 
\q2 plotting deceit all day long. 
\b
\q1 
\v 13 But like a deaf man, I do not hear; 
\q2 and like a mute man, I do not open my mouth. 
\q1 
\v 14 I am like a man who cannot hear, 
\q2 whose mouth offers no reply. 
\q1 
\v 15 I wait for You, O LORD; 
\q2 You will answer, O Lord my God. 
\q1 
\v 16 For I said, “Let them not gloat over me—
\q2 those who taunt me when my foot slips.” 
\b
\q1 
\v 17 For I am ready to fall, 
\q2 and my pain is ever with me. 
\q1 
\v 18 Yes, I confess my iniquity; 
\q2 I am troubled by my sin. 
\q1 
\v 19 Many are my enemies without cause,\f + \fr 38:19 \ft One DSS manuscript; MT My enemies are vigorous and strong\f* 
\q2 and many hate me without reason.\f + \fr 38:19 \ft See John 15:25\f*

\q2 so that I will not sin with my tongue; 
\q1 I will guard my mouth with a muzzle 
\q2 as long as the wicked are present.” 
\q1 
\v 2 I was speechless and still; 
\q2 I remained silent, even from speaking good, 
\q2 and my sorrow was stirred. 
\q1 
\v 3 My heart grew hot within me; 
\q2 as I mused, the fire burned. 
\b
\q1 Then I spoke with my tongue: 
\b
\q1 
\v 4 “Show me, O LORD, my end 
\q2 and the measure of my days. 
\q2 Let me know how fleeting my life is. 
\q1 
\v 5 You, indeed, have made my days as handbreadths, 
\q2 and my lifetime as nothing before You. 
\q1 Truly each man at his best 
\q2 exists as but a breath. 
\qr Selah 
\q1 
\v 6 Surely every man goes about like a phantom; 
\q2 surely he bustles in vain; 
\q1 he heaps up riches

\q1 
\v 7 And now, O Lord, for what do I wait? 
\q2 My hope is in You. 
\q1 
\v 8 Deliver me from all my transgressions; 
\q2 do not make me the reproach of fools. 
\q1 
\v 9 I have become mute; 
\q2 I do not open my mouth 
\q2 because of what You have done. 
\q1 
\v 10 Remove Your scourge from me; 
\q2 I am perishing by the force of Your hand. 
\q1 
\v 11 You discipline and correct a man for his iniquity, 
\q2 consuming like a moth what he holds dear; 
\q2 surely each man is but a vapor. 
\qr Selah 
\q1 
\v 12 Hear my prayer, O LORD, 
\q2 and give ear to my cry for help; 
\q1 do not be deaf to my weeping. 
\q2 For I am a foreigner dwelling with You, 
\q2 a stranger like all my fathers. 
\q1 
\v 13 Turn Your gaze away from me,

\q2 before I depart and am no more.”

\v 1 I waited patiently for the LORD; 
\q2 He inclined to me and heard my cry. 
\q1 
\v 2 He lifted me up from the pit of despair, 
\q2 out of the miry clay; 
\q1 He set my feet upon a rock, 
\q2 and made my footsteps firm. 
\q1 
\v 3 He put a new song in my mouth, 
\q2 a hymn of praise to our God. 
\q1 Many will see and fear

\b
\q1 
\v 11 O LORD, do not withhold Your mercy from me; 
\q2 Your loving devotion and faithfulness will always guard me. 
\q1 
\v 12 For evils without number surround me; 
\q2 my sins have overtaken me, so that I cannot see. 
\q1 They are more than the hairs of my head, 
\q2 and my heart has failed within me. 
\q1 
\v 13 Be pleased, O LORD, to deliver me; 
\q2 hurry, O LORD, to help me.

\b
\q1 
\v 1 As the deer pants for streams of water,

\q1 
\v 4 These things come to mind as I pour out my soul: 
\q2 how I walked with the multitude, 
\q1 leading the procession to the house of God 
\q2 with shouts of joy and praise. 
\b
\q1 
\v 5 Why are you downcast, O my soul? 
\q2 Why the unease within me? 
\q1 Put your hope in God, for I will yet praise Him 
\q2 for the salvation of His presence.

\q1 
\v 6 O my God, my soul despairs within me.

\v 8 The LORD decrees His loving devotion by day, 
\q2 and at night His song is with me 
\q2 as a prayer to the God of my life.

\q1 
\v 6 God settles the lonely in families; 
\q2 He leads the prisoners out to prosperity, 
\q2 but the rebellious dwell in a sun-scorched land. 
\b
\q1 
\v 7 O God, when You went out before Your people, 
\q2 when You marched through the wasteland, 
\qr Selah 
\q1 
\v 8 the earth shook and the heavens poured down rain

\q2 before God, the God of Israel. 
\q1 
\v 9 You sent abundant rain, O God; 
\q2 You refreshed Your weary inheritance. 
\q1 
\v 10 Your flock settled therein; 
\q2 O God, from Your bounty You provided for the poor.

\q2 she who waits at home divides the plunder.

\q1 
\v 3 I am weary from my crying; 
\q2 my throat is parched. 
\q1 My eyes fail,

\q2 O Lord GOD of Hosts; 
\q1 may those who seek You not be dishonored through me,

\q1 
\v 7 For I have endured scorn for Your sake,

\q1 
\v 29 But I am in pain and distress;

\v 13 You divided the sea by Your strength;

\q1 
\v 14 You crushed the heads of Leviathan; 
\q2 You fed him to the creatures of the desert. 
\q1 
\v 15 You broke open the fountain and the flood; 
\q2 You dried up the ever-flowing rivers. 
\q1 
\v 16 The day is Yours, and also the night; 
\q2 You established the moon \f + \fr 74:16 \ft Literally the light\f* and the sun.

\q2 how a foolish people has spurned Your name. 
\q1 
\v 19 Do not deliver the soul of Your dove to beasts; 
\q2 do not forget the lives of Your afflicted forever. 
\q1 
\v 20 Consider Your covenant, 
\q2 for haunts of violence fill the dark places of the land. 
\q1 
\v 21 Do not let the oppressed retreat in shame;

\v 2 In the day of trouble I sought the Lord; 
\q2 through the night my outstretched hands did not grow weary; 
\q2 my soul refused to be comforted. 
\q1 
\v 3 I remembered You, O God, and I groaned; 
\q2 I mused and my spirit grew faint. 
\qr Selah 
\q1 
\v 4 You have kept my eyes from closing; 
\q2 I am too troubled to speak. 
\q1 
\v 5 I considered the days of old, 
\q2 the years long in the past. 
\q1 
\v 6 At night I remembered my song; 
\q2 in my heart I mused, and my spirit pondered: 
\b
\q1 
\v 7 “Will the Lord spurn us forever 
\q2 and never show His favor again? 
\q1 
\v 8 Is His loving devotion gone forever? 
\q2 Has His promise failed for all time? 
\q1 
\v 9 Has God forgotten to be gracious? 
\q2 Has His anger shut off His compassion?” 
\qr Selah 
\q1 
\v 10 So I said, “I am grieved

\v 12 I will reflect on all You have done 
\q2 and ponder Your mighty deeds. 
\q1 
\v 13 Your way, O God, is holy.

\b
\q1 
\v 1 Give ear, O my people, to my instruction;

\q2 but will declare to the next generation 
\q1 the praises of the LORD and His might, 
\q2 and the wonders He has performed. 
\b
\q1 
\v 5 For He established a testimony in Jacob 
\q2 and appointed a law in Israel, 
\q1 which He commanded our fathers 
\q2 to teach to their children, 
\q1 
\v 6 that the coming generation would know them—
\q2 even children yet to be born—
\q2 to arise and tell their own children 
\q1 
\v 7 that they should put their confidence in God,

\q1 
\v 9 The archers of Ephraim 
\q2 turned back on the day of battle. 
\q1 
\v 10 They failed to keep God’s covenant 
\q2 and refused to live by His law. 
\q1 
\v 11 They forgot what He had done, 
\q2 the wonders He had shown them. 
\q1 
\v 12 He worked wonders before their fathers 
\q2 in the land of Egypt, in the region of Zoan. 
\q1 
\v 13 He split the sea and brought them through; 
\q2 He set the waters upright like a wall. 
\q1 
\v 14 He led them with a cloud by day 
\q2 and with a light of fire all night. 
\q1 
\v 15 He split the rocks in the wilderness 
\q2 and gave them drink as abundant as the seas. 
\q1 
\v 16 He brought streams from the stone 
\q2 and made water flow down like rivers. 
\b
\q1 
\v 17 But they continued to sin against Him, 
\q2 rebelling in the desert against the Most High. 
\q1 
\v 18 They willfully tested God 
\q2 by demanding the food they craved. 
\q1 
\v 19 They spoke against God, saying, 
\q2 “Can God really prepare a table in the wilderness? 
\q1 
\v 20 When He struck the rock, water gushed out 
\q2 and torrents raged. 
\q1 But can He also give bread 
\q2 or supply His people with meat?” 
\b

\v 21 Therefore the LORD heard 
\q2 and was filled with wrath; 
\q1 so a fire was kindled against Jacob, 
\q2 and His anger flared against Israel, 
\q1 
\v 22 because they did not believe God 
\q2 or rely on His salvation. 
\b
\q1 
\v 23 Yet He commanded the clouds above 
\q2 and opened the doors of the heavens. 
\q1 
\v 24 He rained down manna for them to eat; 
\q2 He gave them grain from heaven.\f + \fr 78:24 \ft Cited in John 6:31\f*

\v 26 He stirred the east wind from the heavens 
\q2 and drove the south wind by His might. 
\q1 
\v 27 He rained meat on them like dust, 
\q2 and winged birds like the sand of the sea. 
\q1 
\v 28 He felled them in the midst of their camp, 
\q2 all around their dwellings. 
\q1 
\v 29 So they ate and were well filled,

\b
\q1 
\v 30 Yet before they had filled their desire,

\q2 and subdued the young men of Israel. 
\b
\q1 
\v 32 In spite of all this, they kept on sinning;

\q1 
\v 36 But they deceived Him with their mouths,

\q1 
\v 37 Their hearts were disloyal to Him, 
\q2 and they were unfaithful to His covenant. 
\b
\q1 
\v 38 And yet He was compassionate; 
\q2 He forgave their iniquity and did not destroy them. 
\q1 He often restrained His anger 
\q2 and did not unleash His full wrath. 
\q1 
\v 39 He remembered that they were but flesh, 
\q2 a passing breeze that does not return. 
\b
\q1 
\v 40 How often they disobeyed Him in the wilderness 
\q2 and grieved Him in the desert! 
\q1

\b
\q1 
\v 44 He turned their rivers to blood, 
\q2 and from their streams they could not drink. 
\q1 
\v 45 He sent swarms of flies that devoured them, 
\q2 and frogs that devastated them. 
\q1 
\v 46 He gave their crops to the grasshopper,

\q2 wrath, indignation, and calamity—
\q2 a band of destroying angels. 
\q1 
\v 50 He cleared a path for His anger; 
\q2 He did not spare them from death 
\q2 but delivered their lives to the plague. 
\q1 
\v 51 He struck all the firstborn of Egypt, 
\q2 the virility in the tents of Ham. 
\b
\q1 
\v 52 He led out His people like sheep 
\q2 and guided them like a flock in the wilderness. 
\q1 
\v 53 He led them safely, so they did not fear, 
\q2 but the sea engulfed their enemies. 
\q1 
\v 54 He brought them to His holy land, 
\q2 to the mountain His right hand had acquired. 
\q1 
\v 55 He drove out nations before them 
\q2 and apportioned their inheritance; 
\q2 He settled the tribes of Israel in their tents. 
\b
\q1 
\v 56 But they tested and disobeyed God Most High, 
\q2 for they did not keep His decrees. 
\q1 
\v 57 They turned back and were faithless like their fathers, 
\q2 twisted like a faulty bow. 
\q1 
\v 58 They enraged Him with their high places 
\q2 and provoked His jealousy with their idols. 
\b
\q1 
\v 59 On hearing it, God was furious 
\q2 and rejected Israel completely. 
\q1 
\v 60 He abandoned the tabernacle of Shiloh, 
\q2 the tent He had pitched among men. 
\q1 
\v 61 He delivered His strength to captivity, 
\q2 and His splendor to the hand of the adversary. 
\q1 
\v 62 He surrendered His people to the sword 
\q2 because He was enraged by His heritage. 
\q1 
\v 63 Fire consumed His young men, 
\q2 and their maidens were left without wedding songs. 
\q1 
\v 64 His priests fell by the sword,

\b
\q1 
\v 65 Then the Lord awoke as from sleep, 
\q2 like a mighty warrior overcome by wine. 
\q1 
\v 66 He beat back His foes; 
\q2 He put them to everlasting shame. 
\q1 
\v 67 He rejected the tent of Joseph 
\q2 and refused the tribe of Ephraim. 
\q1 
\v 68 But He chose the tribe of Judah,

\q1 
\v 69 He built His sanctuary like the heights,

\q1

\b
\q1 
\v 8 All day long my enemies taunt me;

\q1 
\v 9 For I have eaten ashes like bread

\q1 
\v 5 He set the earth on its foundations,

\q1 
\v 6 You covered it with the deep like a garment;

\q1 
\v 7 At Your rebuke the waters fled; 
\q2 at the sound of Your thunder they hurried away—

\v 8 the mountains rose and the valleys sank

\q1 
\v 13 He waters the mountains from His chambers;

\q1 
\v 10 He confirmed it to Jacob as a decree,

\q1 
\v 12 When they were few in number,

\q1 
\v 13 they wandered from nation to nation,

\q1 
\v 14 He let no man oppress them; 
\q2 He rebuked kings on their behalf: 
\q1 
\v 15 “Do not touch My anointed ones! 
\q2 Do no harm to My prophets!” 
\b
\q1 
\v 16 He called down famine on the land 
\q2 and cut off all their supplies \f + \fr 105:16 \ft Hebrew staff\f* of food. 
\q1 
\v 17 He sent a man before them—
\q2 Joseph, sold as a slave. 
\q1 
\v 18 They bruised his feet with shackles

\q1 
\v 19 until his prediction came true 
\q2 and the word of the LORD proved him right. 
\q1 
\v 20 The king sent and released him;

\q1 
\v 31 He spoke, and insects swarmed—
\q2 gnats throughout their country. 
\q1 
\v 32 He gave them hail for rain, 
\q2 with lightning throughout their land. 
\q1 
\v 33 He struck their vines and fig trees 
\q2 and shattered the trees of their country. 
\q1 
\v 34 He spoke, and the locusts came—
\q2 young locusts without number. 
\q1 
\v 35 They devoured every plant in their land

\v 36 Then He struck all the firstborn in their land,

\q2 He redeemed them from the hand of the enemy. 
\q1 
\v 11 The waters covered their foes; 
\q2 not one of them remained. 
\q1 
\v 12 Then they believed His promises 
\q2 and sang His praise. 
\b
\q1 
\v 13 Yet they soon forgot His works 
\q2 and failed to wait for His counsel. 
\q1 
\v 14 They craved intensely in the wilderness 
\q2 and tested God in the desert. 
\q1 
\v 15 So He granted their request, 
\q2 but sent a wasting disease upon them. 
\b
\q1 
\v 16 In the camp they envied Moses,

\q1 
\v 19 At Horeb \f + \fr 106:19 \ft That is, Mount Sinai, or possibly a mountain in the range containing Mount Sinai\f* they made a calf

\q1 
\v 21 They forgot God their Savior,

\v 22 wondrous works in the land of Ham, 
\q2 and awesome deeds by the Red Sea. 
\q1 
\v 23 So He said He would destroy them—
\q2 had not Moses His chosen one 
\q1 stood before Him in the breach 
\q2 to divert His wrath from destroying them. 
\b
\q1 
\v 24 They despised the pleasant land; 
\q2 they did not believe His promise. 
\q1 
\v 25 They grumbled in their tents 
\q2 and did not listen to the voice of the LORD. 
\q1 
\v 26 So He raised His hand and swore

\q2 and a plague broke out among them. 
\q1 
\v 30 But Phinehas stood and intervened, 
\q2 and the plague was restrained. 
\q1 
\v 31 It was credited to him as righteousness

\b
\q1 
\v 32 At the waters of Meribah \f + \fr 106:32 \ft Meribah means quarreling; see Exodus 17:7.\f* they angered the LORD,

\q1 
\v 34 They did not destroy the peoples 
\q2 as the LORD had commanded them, 
\q1 
\v 35 but they mingled with the nations 
\q2 and adopted their customs. 
\q1 
\v 36 They worshiped their idols, 
\q2 which became a snare to them. 
\q1 
\v 37 They sacrificed their sons 
\q2 and their daughters to demons. 
\q1 
\v 38 They shed innocent blood—
\q2 the blood of their sons and daughters, 
\q1 whom they sacrificed to the idols of Canaan, 
\q2 and the land was polluted with blood. 
\q1 
\v 39 They defiled themselves by their actions 
\q2 and prostituted themselves by their deeds. 
\b
\q1 
\v 40 So the anger of the LORD burned against His people, 
\q2 and He abhorred His own inheritance. 
\q1 
\v 41 He delivered them into the hand of the nations, 
\q2 and those who hated them ruled over them. 
\q1 
\v 42 Their enemies oppressed them, 
\q2 and subdued them under their hand. 
\q1 
\v 43 Many times He rescued them, 
\q2 but they were bent on rebellion 
\q2 and sank down in their iniquity. 
\b
\q1 
\v 44 Nevertheless He heard their cry;

\q1 
\v 45 And He remembered His covenant with them, 
\q2 and relented by the abundance of His loving devotion. 
\q1 
\v 46 He made them objects of compassion

\q1 
\v 25 I am an object of scorn to my accusers; 
\q2 when they see me, they shake their heads. 
\b
\q1 
\v 26 Help me, O LORD my God; 
\q2 save me according to Your loving devotion. 
\q1 
\v 27 Let them know that this is Your hand, 
\q2 that You, O LORD, have done it. 
\q1 
\v 28 Though they curse, You will bless. 
\q2 When they rise up, they will be put to shame, 
\q2 but Your servant will rejoice. 
\q1 
\v 29 May my accusers be clothed with disgrace; 
\q2 may they wear their shame like a robe. 
\q1 
\v 30 With my mouth I will thank the LORD profusely; 
\q2 I will praise Him in the presence of many. 
\q1 
\v 31 For He stands at the right hand of the needy one,
