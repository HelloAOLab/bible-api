# A Biblical Model for Licensing The Bible

**“...freely you have received; freely give.” - Mathew 10:8**

Christians believe that Jesus’ words are the very words of God and were freely given to mankind at great cost to Jesus himself who left behind every comfort to take on human flesh and share in our suffering.

Likewise, far be it from us to create any paywalls or other barriers that hinder others from creating experiences that glorify the word of God.

In our search to find a partner who was willing to share a full, quality English translation of the Bible with the world free of charge and without usage restrictions via an API we could tragically only find a single partner who was willing and able. We are tremendously grateful beyond words to the [Berean Bible team](https://berean.bible/) that has made this API possible.

The creation of the Berean Bible was born out of necessity as the leadership had provided [BibleHub](https://biblehub.com/) as a service to the general public and had years first-hand experience of licensors providing then revoking licenses upon updates, term limits running out, and many other related issues. At long last the BibleHub team decided to create their own translation to ensure an English translation could freely be used by the world without publisher or licensor restrictions.

If you have or know of any other translations of the Bible that are likewise willing to make texts available free of charge and without usage restrictions please contact us at [hello@helloao.org](mailto:hello@helloao.org)

Lastly, we pray every copyright holder or publisher of Biblical texts that restricts their usage via a license seriously and carefully considers what Jesus might say to them upon His return.

Thank you!
